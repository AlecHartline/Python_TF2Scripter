alias Shrek1065 "say "
alias Shrek1066 "say "
alias Shrek1067 "say They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There "
alias Shrek1068 "say is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where "
alias Shrek1069 "say the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very "
alias Shrek1070 "say foreboding."
alias Shrek1071 "say "
alias Shrek1072 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1073 "say Sure, it's big enough, but look at the "

alias Shrek1192 "say Shh."
alias Shrek1193 "say DONKEY"
alias Shrek1194 "say Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton "
alias Shrek1195 "say and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong "
alias Shrek1196 "say with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible "
alias Shrek1197 "say response to an unfamiliar situation. "
alias Shrek1198 "say Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might "
alias Shrek1199 "say add. With a dragon that breathes fire "
alias Shrek1200 "say and eats knights and breathes fire, "

alias Shrek1229 "say Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle "
alias Shrek1230 "say the stairs. I'll find those stairs. "
alias Shrek1231 "say I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs "

alias Shrek1237 "say "
alias Shrek1238 "say "
alias Shrek1239 "say DONKEY"
alias Shrek1240 "say I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it "
alias Shrek1241 "say to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm "
alias Shrek1242 "say the stair master. I've mastered the "
alias Shrek1243 "say stairs. I wish I had a step right here. "
alias Shrek1244 "say I'd step all over it."
alias Shrek1245 "say "
alias Shrek1246 "say ELSEWHERE"
alias Shrek1247 "say Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window."
alias Shrek1248 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1249 "say Well, at least we know where the princess "
alias Shrek1250 "say is, but where's the..."
alias Shrek1251 "say "
alias Shrek1252 "say DONKEY"
alias Shrek1253 "say (os) Dragon!"
alias Shrek1254 "say Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. "
alias Shrek1255 "say Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon "
alias Shrek1256 "say breathes fire."
alias Shrek1257 "say "
alias Shrek1258 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1259 "say Donkey, look out! (he manages to get "
alias Shrek1260 "say a hold of the dragons tail and holds "
alias Shrek1261 "say on) Got ya!"
alias Shrek1262 "say "
alias Shrek1263 "say The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek "
alias Shrek1264 "say goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the "
alias Shrek1265 "say tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying "
alias Shrek1266 "say on the floor."
alias Shrek1267 "say "
alias Shrek1268 "say DONKEY"
alias Shrek1269 "say Oh! Aah! Aah!"
alias Shrek1270 "say Donkey get cornered as the Dragon knocks away all but a small "
alias Shrek1271 "say part of the bridge he's on."
alias Shrek1272 "say "
alias Shrek1273 "say DONKEY"
alias Shrek1274 "say No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh, "
alias Shrek1275 "say what large teeth you have. (the dragon "
alias Shrek1276 "say growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth. "
alias Shrek1277 "say I know you probably hear this all time "
alias Shrek1278 "say from your food, but you must bleach, "
alias Shrek1279 "say 'cause that is one dazzling smile you "
alias Shrek1280 "say got there. Do I detect a hint of minty "
alias Shrek1281 "say freshness? And you know what else? You're "
alias Shrek1282 "say - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! "
alias Shrek1283 "say I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. "
alias Shrek1284 "say You're just reeking of feminine beauty. "
alias Shrek1285 "say (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes "
alias Shrek1286 "say at him) What's the matter with you? "
alias Shrek1287 "say You got something in your eye? Ohh. "
alias Shrek1288 "say Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, "
alias Shrek1289 "say but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon "
alias Shrek1290 "say blows a smoke ring in the shape of a "
alias Shrek1291 "say heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm "
alias Shrek1292 "say an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd "
alias Shrek1293 "say work out if you're gonna blow smoke "
alias Shrek1294 "say rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him "
alias Shrek1295 "say up with her teeth and carries him off) "
alias Shrek1296 "say No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!"
alias Shrek1297 "say "
alias Shrek1298 "say FIONA'S ROOM"
alias Shrek1299 "say Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona "
alias Shrek1300 "say so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She "
alias Shrek1301 "say then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off "
alias Shrek1302 "say the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep. "
alias Shrek1303 "say Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for "
alias Shrek1304 "say a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders "
alias Shrek1305 "say and shakes her away."
alias Shrek1306 "say "
alias Shrek1307 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1308 "say Oh! Oh!"
alias Shrek1309 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1310 "say Wake up!"
alias Shrek1311 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1312 "say What?"
alias Shrek1313 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1314 "say Are you Princess Fiona?"
alias Shrek1315 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1316 "say I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to "
alias Shrek1317 "say rescue me."
alias Shrek1318 "say "
alias Shrek1319 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1320 "say Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!"
alias Shrek1321 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1322 "say But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our "
alias Shrek1323 "say first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, "
alias Shrek1324 "say romantic moment?"
alias Shrek1325 "say "
alias Shrek1326 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1327 "say Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time."
alias Shrek1328 "say "
alias Shrek1329 "say "
alias Shrek1330 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1331 "say Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should "
alias Shrek1332 "say sweep me off my feet out yonder window "
alias Shrek1333 "say and down a rope onto your valiant steed."
alias Shrek1334 "say "
alias Shrek1335 "say "
alias Shrek1336 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1337 "say You've had a lot of time to plan this, "
alias Shrek1338 "say haven't you?"
alias Shrek1339 "say "
alias Shrek1340 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1341 "say (smiles) Mm-hmm."
alias Shrek1342 "say Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down "
alias Shrek1343 "say the hallway."
alias Shrek1344 "say "
alias Shrek1345 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1346 "say But we have to savor this moment! You "
alias Shrek1347 "say could recite an epic poem for me. A "
alias Shrek1348 "say ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!"
alias Shrek1349 "say "
alias Shrek1350 "say "
alias Shrek1351 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1352 "say I don't think so."
alias Shrek1353 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1354 "say Can I at least know the name of my champion?"
alias Shrek1355 "say "
alias Shrek1356 "say "
alias Shrek1357 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1358 "say Uh, Shrek."
alias Shrek1359 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1360 "say Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds "
alias Shrek1361 "say out a handkerchief) I pray that you "
alias Shrek1362 "say take this favor as a token of my gratitude."
alias Shrek1363 "say "
alias Shrek1364 "say "
alias Shrek1365 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1366 "say Thanks!"
alias Shrek1367 "say Suddenly they hear the dragon roar."
alias Shrek1368 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1369 "say (surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?"
alias Shrek1370 "say "
alias Shrek1371 "say "
alias Shrek1372 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1373 "say It's on my to-do list. Now come on! "
alias Shrek1374 "say (takes off running and drags Fiona behind "
alias Shrek1375 "say him.)"
alias Shrek1376 "say "
alias Shrek1377 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1378 "say But this isn't right! You were meant "
alias Shrek1379 "say to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. "
alias Shrek1380 "say That's what all the other knights did."
alias Shrek1381 "say "
alias Shrek1382 "say "
alias Shrek1383 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1384 "say Yeah, right before they burst into flame."
alias Shrek1385 "say "
alias Shrek1386 "say "
alias Shrek1387 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1388 "say That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly "
alias Shrek1389 "say stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek "
alias Shrek1390 "say ignores her and heads for a wooden door "
alias Shrek1391 "say off to the side.) Wait. Where are you "
alias Shrek1392 "say going? The exit's over there."
alias Shrek1393 "say "
alias Shrek1394 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1395 "say Well, I have to save my ass."
alias Shrek1396 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1397 "say What kind of knight are you?"
alias Shrek1398 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1399 "say One of a kind. (opens the door into "
alias Shrek1400 "say the throne room)"
alias Shrek1401 "say "
alias Shrek1402 "say DONKEY"
alias Shrek1403 "say (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. "
alias Shrek1404 "say I believe it's healthy to get to know "
alias Shrek1405 "say someone over a long period of time. "
alias Shrek1406 "say Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs "
alias Shrek1407 "say worriedly) (we see him up close and "
alias Shrek1408 "say from a distance as Shrek sneaks into "
alias Shrek1409 "say the room) I don't want to rush into "
alias Shrek1410 "say a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally "
alias Shrek1411 "say ready for a commitment of, uh, this "
alias Shrek1412 "say - - Magnitude really is the word I'm "
alias Shrek1413 "say looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that "
alias Shrek1414 "say is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what "
alias Shrek1415 "say are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just "
alias Shrek1416 "say back up a little and take this one step "
alias Shrek1417 "say at a time. We really should get to know "
alias Shrek1418 "say each other first as friends or pen pals. "
alias Shrek1419 "say I'm on the road a lot, but I just love "
alias Shrek1420 "say receiving cards - - I'd really love "
alias Shrek1421 "say to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's "
alias Shrek1422 "say my tail! That's my personal tail. You're "
alias Shrek1423 "say gonna tear it off. I don't give permission "
alias Shrek1424 "say - - What are you gonna do with that? "
alias Shrek1425 "say Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. "
alias Shrek1426 "say No, no, no. No! Oh!"
alias Shrek1427 "say "
alias Shrek1428 "say Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings "
alias Shrek1429 "say toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks "
alias Shrek1430 "say up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. "
alias Shrek1431 "say He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps "
alias Shrek1432 "say Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. "
alias Shrek1433 "say Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and "
alias Shrek1434 "say roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto "
alias Shrek1435 "say her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms "
alias Shrek1436 "say a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey "
alias Shrek1437 "say take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and "
alias Shrek1438 "say then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her."
alias Shrek1439 "say "
alias Shrek1440 "say DONKEY"
alias Shrek1441 "say Hi, Princess!"
alias Shrek1442 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1443 "say It talks!"
alias Shrek1444 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1445 "say Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's "
alias Shrek1446 "say the trick."
alias Shrek1447 "say "
alias Shrek1448 "say They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots "
alias Shrek1449 "say a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a "
alias Shrek1450 "say crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His "
alias Shrek1451 "say eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles "
alias Shrek1452 "say off and walks lightly."
alias Shrek1453 "say "
alias Shrek1454 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1455 "say Oh!"
alias Shrek1456 "say Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona."
alias Shrek1457 "say "
alias Shrek1458 "say "
alias Shrek1459 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1460 "say Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll "
alias Shrek1461 "say take care of the dragon."
alias Shrek1462 "say "
alias Shrek1463 "say Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the "
alias Shrek1464 "say castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping "
alias Shrek1465 "say chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that "
alias Shrek1466 "say is still around the dragons neck."
alias Shrek1467 "say "
alias Shrek1468 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1469 "say (echoing) Run!"
alias Shrek1470 "say They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot "
alias Shrek1471 "say pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons "
alias Shrek1472 "say breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on "
alias Shrek1473 "say for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They "
alias Shrek1474 "say are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look "
alias Shrek1475 "say in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to "
alias Shrek1476 "say get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the "
alias Shrek1477 "say dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs "
alias Shrek1478 "say quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a "
alias Shrek1479 "say sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away."
alias Shrek1480 "say "
alias Shrek1481 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1482 "say (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You "
alias Shrek1483 "say did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. "
alias Shrek1484 "say (behind her Donkey falls down the hill) "
alias Shrek1485 "say You're - - You're wonderful. You're... "
alias Shrek1486 "say (turns and sees Shrek fall down the "
alias Shrek1487 "say hill and bump into Donkey) a little "
alias Shrek1488 "say unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed "
alias Shrek1489 "say is great, and thy heart is pure. I am "
alias Shrek1490 "say eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears "
alias Shrek1491 "say his throat.) And where would a brave "
alias Shrek1492 "say knight be without his noble steed?"
alias Shrek1493 "say "
alias Shrek1494 "say "
alias Shrek1495 "say DONKEY"
alias Shrek1496 "say I hope you heard that. She called me "
alias Shrek1497 "say a noble steed. She think I'm a steed."
alias Shrek1498 "say "
alias Shrek1499 "say "
alias Shrek1500 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1501 "say The battle is won. You may remove your "
alias Shrek1502 "say helmet, good Sir Knight."
alias Shrek1503 "say "
alias Shrek1504 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1505 "say Uh, no."
alias Shrek1506 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1507 "say Why not?"
alias Shrek1508 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1509 "say I have helmet hair."
alias Shrek1510 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1511 "say Please. I would'st look upon the face "
alias Shrek1512 "say of my rescuer."
alias Shrek1513 "say "
alias Shrek1514 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1515 "say No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st."
alias Shrek1516 "say FIONA"
alias Shrek1517 "say But how will you kiss me?"
alias Shrek1518 "say SHREK"
alias Shrek1519 "say What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the "
alias Shrek1520 "say job description."
alias Shrek1521 "say "
