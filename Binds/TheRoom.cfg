alias TheRoom37 "say Denny: No, stop!"
alias TheRoom38 "say Johnny: Denny, do you have something else to do?"
alias TheRoom39 "say Denny: I just like to watch you guys."
alias TheRoom40 "say Lisa: Oh, Denny, Denny, Denny boy!"
alias TheRoom41 "say Johnny: Denny, two’s great, but three’s a crowd, ha-ha."
alias TheRoom42 "say Denny: I get it. You guys want to be alone."
alias TheRoom43 "say Johnny: That’s the idea!"
alias TheRoom44 "say Denny: Fine. I have homework to do anyway. Bye, lovebirds!"
alias TheRoom45 "say Johnny: Bye, Denny."
alias TheRoom46 "say Lisa: Bye, Denny."
alias TheRoom47 "say Denny exits, and a three-minute love scene commences, scored to terrible R&B. There’s a lot of water and rose petals and naked boobs. Johnny fucks Lisa’s belly button. Afterwards they lie awkwardly in bed together, and Lisa seems bored with Johnny as he sleeps."
alias TheRoom48 "say The alarm clock goes off at :28. Johnny gets up, smells a rose, and bares his ass to the camera. He emerges from the bathroom dressed for work and greets Lisa."

alias TheRoom59 "say Lisa: Nothing much. Do you want some coffee?"
alias TheRoom60 "say Claudette: What’s wrong? Tell me."
alias TheRoom61 "say Lisa: I’m not feeling good today."
alias TheRoom62 "say Claudette: Well, why not?"
alias TheRoom63 "say Lisa: I don’t love him anymore."

alias TheRoom65 "say Lisa: He’s so boring."
alias TheRoom66 "say Claudette: You’ve known him for over five years. You’re engaged. You said you loved him. He supports you, he provides for you, and darling, you can’t support yourself.

alias TheRoom67 "say Lisa: That’s why he’s so boring!"
alias TheRoom68 "say Claudette: Well, what are you going to do?"
alias TheRoom69 "say Lisa: I don’t know. I don’t mind living with him."
alias TheRoom70 "say Claudette: Well, you can’t do that. Have you talked to him about it?"
alias TheRoom71 "say Lisa: No. I don’t know what to do."
alias TheRoom72 "say Claudette: Well, he’s a wonderful person. And he’s getting a promotion very soon. Now he bought you a car, he bought you a ring, clothes, whatever you wanted, and now you want to dump him. That’s not right. I’ve always thought of him as my son-in-law. You should marry Johnny, he would be good for you."
alias TheRoom73 "say Lisa: I guess you’re right about that."
alias TheRoom74 "say Claudette: Well, of course I’m right. I know men! I wasn’t born yesterday. I’m glad you’re listening to your mother. Nobody else listens to me."
alias TheRoom75 "say Lisa: You’re probably right about that, mom."
alias TheRoom76 "say Claudette: Well, I’m glad you’re listening to your mother. Listen, I’ve gotta go. But you remember what I told you, okay? M-hm. Bye bye now."
alias TheRoom77 "say Claudette exits"
alias TheRoom78 "say Lisa: (sarcastically) Thanks, mom."
alias TheRoom79 "say The same room, later in the day. Lisa picks up the phone and Mark answers on the other end."
alias TheRoom80 "say Mark: Hello?"
alias TheRoom81 "say Lisa: Hey baby, how are you doing?"
alias TheRoom82 "say Mark: Oh hey, how you doing? Yeah, I’m very busy, what’s going on?"
alias TheRoom83 "say Lisa: I just finished talking to my mom. She gave me this big lecture about Johnny."
alias TheRoom84 "say Mark: Look, we’ll talk about it later. I told you, I’m very busy."
alias TheRoom85 "say Lisa: We’ll talk about it now! Whenever you say we’ll talk about it later, we never do. I can’t wait till later. I want to talk right now. You owe me one anyway."
alias TheRoom86 "say Mark: Okay. Alright, what do you want to talk about?"
alias TheRoom87 "say Lisa: She’s a stupid bitch. She wants to control my life. I’m not going to put up with that. I’m going to do what I want to do, and that’s it. What do you think I should do?"
alias TheRoom88 "say Mark: I mean, why do you ask me? You know, you’ve been very happy with Johnny. What do you want me to say? I mean, you should enjoy your life. What’s the problem?"
alias TheRoom89 "say Lisa: Maybe, you’re right. Can I see you tomorrow?"

alias TheRoom105 "say Mark: Johnny’s my best friend. You’re going to be married next month. Come on."
alias TheRoom106 "say Lisa: Forget about Johnny. This is between you and me."
alias TheRoom107 "say Mark: I don’t think so. I’m leaving now."
alias TheRoom108 "say Lisa: Please don’t leave. Please don’t leave. I need you. I love you. I don’t want to get married anymore. I don’t love Johnny. I dream about you. I need you to make love to me."
alias TheRoom109 "say Mark: I don’t think so. Everything’s going to be fine, I promise."
alias TheRoom110 "say They proceed to kiss, then have fully clothed three-minute sex on the spiral stairs to the tune of terrible R&B (“you are my rose”)."

alias TheRoom112 "say Lisa: Didn’t you enjoy it?"
alias TheRoom113 "say Mark: That’s not the point."
alias TheRoom114 "say Lisa: I love you, Mark."
alias TheRoom115 "say Mark: Look, you’re very attractive, alright? You’re beautiful. But we can’t do this anymore. I can’t hurt Johnny."

alias TheRoom124 "say Florist: Oh hi, Johnny, I didn’t know it was you. Here you go."
alias TheRoom125 "say Johnny: That’s me! How much is it?"
alias TheRoom126 "say Florist: It’ll be eighteen dollars."
alias TheRoom127 "say Johnny: Here you go, keep the change. Hi doggy!"
alias TheRoom128 "say Florist: You’re my favorite customer."
alias TheRoom129 "say Johnny: Thanks a lot, bye!"
alias TheRoom130 "say Florist: Bye bye!"
alias TheRoom131 "say Johnny exits with the roses and gets in his car."
alias TheRoom132 "say Cut to Lisa in the room, talking on the phone."
alias TheRoom133 "say Lisa: Yeah, delivery. 555-4828. Half Canadian bacon with pineapple, half artichoke with pesto and light on the cheese. Thanks."

alias TheRoom137 "say Lisa: Hey Denny, how are you doing?"
alias TheRoom138 "say Denny: I’m fine. What’s new?"
alias TheRoom139 "say Lisa: Actually I’m really busy. Do you want something to drink?"
alias TheRoom140 "say Denny: No thanks. I just want to talk to Johnny. You look beautiful today. Can I kiss you?"
alias TheRoom141 "say Lisa: You are such a little brat!"
alias TheRoom142 "say Denny: I’m just kidding! I love you and Johnny."
alias TheRoom143 "say Lisa: Okay, okay. Johnny’s going to be here any minute. You can wait if you want."

alias TheRoom149 "say Johnny enters the room."
alias TheRoom150 "say Johnny: Hi babe. These are for you. (he presents a bouquet of roses)"
alias TheRoom151 "say Lisa: Thanks honey, they’re beautiful. Did you get your promotion?"
alias TheRoom152 "say Johnny: Nah."
alias TheRoom153 "say Lisa: You didn’t get it, did you?"
alias TheRoom154 "say Johnny: That son of a bitch told me that I would get it within three months. I save them bundles. They’re crazy. I don’t think I will ever get it. They betray me, they didn’t keep their promise, they tricked me, and I don’t care anymore."
alias TheRoom155 "say Lisa: Did you tell them how much you save them?"
alias TheRoom156 "say Johnny: Of course, what do you think? They already put my ideas into practice. The bank saves money, and they are using me, and I am the fool."
alias TheRoom157 "say Lisa: I still love you."
alias TheRoom158 "say Johnny: You’re the only one who does."
alias TheRoom159 "say Lisa: At least you have friends. I didn’t get any calls today. You’re right. The computer business is too competitive. Do you want me to order a pizza?"
alias TheRoom160 "say Johnny: Whatever, I don’t care."
alias TheRoom161 "say Lisa: I already ordered a pizza."
alias TheRoom162 "say Johnny: You think about everything, ha-ha."
alias TheRoom163 "say Lisa: What’s the matter? Are you alright? It’s just a lousy promotion. You know what you need? You need a drink."
alias TheRoom164 "say Johnny: I don’t drink, you know that!"
alias TheRoom165 "say Cut to Lisa emerging from the kitchen with, it seems, scotch and vodka."
alias TheRoom166 "say Johnny: Ha-ha-ha-ha."
alias TheRoom167 "say She mixes them to form scotchka."
alias TheRoom168 "say Lisa: Don’t worry about it. It’s good for you."
alias TheRoom169 "say Johnny: You must be crazy. I cannot drink this."
alias TheRoom170 "say Lisa: If you love me, you’ll drink this."
alias TheRoom171 "say She raises his glass to his mouth and he drinks."
alias TheRoom172 "say Johnny: You’re right, it tastes good. A-ha."
alias TheRoom173 "say Lisa: I know. I am right. Don’t worry about those fuckers. You’re a good man. Drink and let’s have some fun."
alias TheRoom174 "say They drink. Cut to later, when they have had quite a bit to drink and Lisa is now wearing Johnny’s tie as a headband."
alias TheRoom175 "say Johnny: Ha-ha-ha. A-ha-ha-ha. Mmm."
alias TheRoom176 "say Lisa laughs hysterically. Johnny drops and shatters a glass."
alias TheRoom177 "say Johnny: You have nice legs, Lisa. Ha-ha."
alias TheRoom178 "say Lisa: (laughing) You have nice pecs."
alias TheRoom179 "say Johnny: A-ha-ha. I’m tired, I’m wasted, I love you darling!"
alias TheRoom180 "say Lisa: Come on, make love to me."
alias TheRoom181 "say Johnny: Unhhh…"
alias TheRoom182 "say Lisa: Come on, you owe me one."
alias TheRoom183 "say Johnny: I love you, Lisa."
alias TheRoom184 "say Lisa: I love you, Johnny. (she rips open his shirt)"
alias TheRoom185 "say They make out on the couch, and then we cut to the bedroom for a lovemaking sequence that seems to be recut from their previous lovemaking sequence, but with a different terrible R&B song. Mercifully, it only lasts for about a minute."
alias TheRoom186 "say Cut to the famous “painted ladies” of San Francisco."
alias TheRoom187 "say Cut to the room."
alias TheRoom188 "say Lisa: So I’m organizing the party for Johnny’s birthday. Can you come?"
alias TheRoom189 "say Claudette: When is it?"
alias TheRoom190 "say Lisa: Next Friday at six. It’s a surprise."
alias TheRoom191 "say Claudette: Oh."
alias TheRoom192 "say Lisa: You can bring someone if you want."
alias TheRoom193 "say Claudette: Well, sure, I can come. But I don’t know if I’ll bring anybody. Oh! That jerk Harold. He wants me to give him a share of my house. That house belongs to me. He has no right. I’m not giving him a penny. Who does he think he is?"
alias TheRoom194 "say Lisa: He’s your brother!"
alias TheRoom195 "say Claudette: He’s always bugging me about my house. Fifteen years ago, we agreed, that house belongs to me. Now the value of the house is going up and he’s seeing dollar signs. Everything goes wrong at once. Nobody wants to help me, and I’m dying."
alias TheRoom196 "say Lisa: You’re not dying, mom."
alias TheRoom197 "say Claudette: I got the results of the test back. I definitely have breast cancer."
alias TheRoom198 "say Lisa: Look, don’t worry about it. Everything will be fine. They’re curing lots of people every day."
alias TheRoom199 "say Claudette: I’m sure I’ll be alright. Oh! I heard Edward is talking about me. He is a hateful man. Oh, I’m so glad I divorced him."
alias TheRoom200 "say Lisa: Don’t worry about it. You just concentrate on getting well."
alias TheRoom201 "say Claudette: Well at least you have a good man."
alias TheRoom202 "say Lisa: You’re wrong! Mom, he’s not what you think he is. He didn’t get his promotion. And he got drunk last night. And he hit me."
alias TheRoom203 "say Claudette: Johnny doesn’t drink! What are you talking about?"
alias TheRoom204 "say Lisa: He did last night. And I don’t love him anymore."
alias TheRoom205 "say Claudette: Johnny is your financial security. You can’t afford to ignore this."
alias TheRoom206 "say Lisa: Yeah, okay mom. Can I just talk to you later?"
alias TheRoom207 "say Claudette: You don’t want to talk to me."
alias TheRoom208 "say Lisa: I just got done talking with a client, and I have to get ready to meet him. Can I just talk to you later?"
alias TheRoom209 "say Claudette: Okay. I will see you later. Bye bye."
alias TheRoom210 "say Claudette exits. Cut to an exterior shot of the house."
alias TheRoom211 "say Cut to the room. Michelle and Mike enter, nervously."
alias TheRoom212 "say Michelle: How much time do we have?"
alias TheRoom213 "say Mike: I dunno, uh, a couple hours? At least."
alias TheRoom214 "say Michelle: Well, let’s have some fun."
alias TheRoom215 "say They sit on the couch and Mike opens a box of chocolates."
alias TheRoom216 "say Mike: Did you, uh, know, that chocolate is the symbol of love?"
alias TheRoom217 "say Michelle: (laughing) Feed me."
alias TheRoom218 "say Mike puts a chocolate in Michelle’s mouth and then makes out with her. He puts a chocolate on her chest and eats it off of her."
alias TheRoom219 "say Michelle: Yum!"
alias TheRoom220 "say Mike: It’s delicious!"
alias TheRoom221 "say Michelle: Arms up! (she takes off Mike’s shirt) Chocolate is a symbol of love."
alias TheRoom222 "say Michelle places a chocolate in Mike’s mouth and then makes out with him. She starts to go down on him, although he begins reacting with comically exaggerated orgasm faces before she’s in position to do anything."
alias TheRoom223 "say Cut to an exterior shot of the painted ladies."
alias TheRoom224 "say Cut to the room, where Mike and Michelle are startled by Lisa and Claudette entering."
alias TheRoom225 "say Claudette: Hello? What are these characters doing here?"
alias TheRoom226 "say Lisa: They like to come here to do their… homework."
alias TheRoom227 "say Claudette: What homework?"
alias TheRoom228 "say Lisa: Mom, this is Michelle’s boyfriend Mike. Mike, this is my mother."
alias TheRoom229 "say Mike: It’s a pleasure to meet you."
alias TheRoom230 "say Claudette: Mm."
alias TheRoom231 "say Michelle: Uh-huh."
alias TheRoom232 "say Mike and Michelle exit."
alias TheRoom233 "say Claudette: Unh. Oh, all that shopping wore me out."
alias TheRoom234 "say Denny enters."
alias TheRoom235 "say Denny: Hi Lisa."
alias TheRoom236 "say Lisa: Hey Denny. Denny, this is my mom. Mom, this is Denny."
alias TheRoom237 "say Claudette: How many people come in and out of this apartment every day? This is worse than Grand Central Station!"
alias TheRoom238 "say Denny: I just need to borrow some sugar."
alias TheRoom239 "say Lisa: Help yourself, Denny."
alias TheRoom240 "say Denny: I also need a cup of flour and half a stick of butter."
alias TheRoom241 "say Claudette: Doesn’t your home have a kitchen?"
alias TheRoom242 "say Denny: I’ll come back later."
alias TheRoom243 "say Denny exits."
alias TheRoom244 "say Claudette: Tell me, what does Denny do?"
alias TheRoom245 "say Lisa: Johnny wanted to adopt Denny. It’s really a tragedy how many kids out there don’t have parents. When Denny turned eighteen, Johnny found him a little apartment here in this building and he’s paying for it until he graduates from school. Johnny really loves Denny even though he doesn’t say it much. He’s like a father figure to him. I told you, mom, Johnny is very caring about the people in his life. And he gave Denny his own set of keys to our place."
alias TheRoom246 "say Claudette: Please, don’t hurt Johnny. Now if you really don’t love him, so be it, but you should tell him."
alias TheRoom247 "say Mike enters."
alias TheRoom248 "say Mike: I forgot my, uh, book."
alias TheRoom249 "say He grabs a book but somehow this leads to Claudette holding his underwear."
alias TheRoom250 "say Claudette: What’s this?"
alias TheRoom251 "say Everyone laughs."
alias TheRoom252 "say Mike: That’s nothing!"
alias TheRoom253 "say Mike takes the underwear and exits as everyone continues to laugh."
alias TheRoom254 "say Claudette: Homework!"
alias TheRoom255 "say Lisa: (laughing) Don’t worry about it."
alias TheRoom256 "say Claudette: If I were a burglar, you would be my best friend."
alias TheRoom257 "say Lisa: Look, I don’t want to talk about it."
alias TheRoom258 "say Claudette: You know I worry about you. I have to go home."
alias TheRoom259 "say Lisa: Okay, mom."
alias TheRoom260 "say Claudette: Bye bye."
alias TheRoom261 "say Claudette exits."
alias TheRoom262 "say Lisa: (sighing) Oh my god."
alias TheRoom263 "say Cut to exterior shot of the San Francisco skyline."
alias TheRoom264 "say Cut to the roof, where Denny is dribbling a basketball. This scene is in HD for some reason. Chris-R enters."
alias TheRoom265 "say Chris-R: Hey, Denny."
alias TheRoom266 "say Denny: Chris-R. I’ve been looking for you."
alias TheRoom267 "say Chris-R: Yeah, sure you have. You have my money, right?"
alias TheRoom268 "say Denny: Yeah. It’s coming. It’ll be here in a few minutes."
alias TheRoom269 "say Chris-R: What do you mean it’s coming, Denny? Where’s my money?"
alias TheRoom270 "say Denny: Okay. Just give me five minutes. Just give me five!"
alias TheRoom271 "say Chris-R: Five minutes? You want five fucking minutes, Denny? You know what? I haven’t got five fucking minutes! (he pulls a gun on Denny) I’m going to ask you again, Denny. Where’s my money?"
alias TheRoom272 "say Denny: I don’t have anything."
alias TheRoom273 "say Chris-R: Where’s my money, Denny? Where’s my fucking money, Denny? What’d you do with my fucking money?"
alias TheRoom274 "say Denny: I swear to god, it’s coming!"
alias TheRoom275 "say Chris-R: Where’s my fucking money, Denny?"
alias TheRoom276 "say Denny: Put the gun down."
alias TheRoom277 "say Mark and Johnny enter."
alias TheRoom278 "say Chris-R: My fucking money! Where’s my fucking money, Denny?"
alias TheRoom279 "say Johnny and Mark grab Chris-R and disarm him. Lisa and Claudette enter, or rather, they are suddenly in the scene without explanation."
alias TheRoom280 "say Lisa: What’s going on?!"
alias TheRoom281 "say Johnny and Mark haul Chris-R away amid indecipherable commotion."
alias TheRoom282 "say Johnny: Let’s take him to the police."
alias TheRoom283 "say Lisa: Denny, are you okay? What did that man want from you?"
alias TheRoom284 "say Denny: Nothing."
alias TheRoom285 "say Claudette: Oh, that was not nothing!"

alias TheRoom298 "say Claudette: A man like that, with a gun! My god!"
alias TheRoom299 "say Lisa: Denny, look at me in the eyes and tell me the truth. We’re your friends."
alias TheRoom300 "say Denny: I bought some drugs off of him. Things got mixed up. I didn’t mean for this to happen."
alias TheRoom301 "say Lisa: (sobbing) Denny…"
alias TheRoom302 "say Denny: But I don’t have them anymore."
alias TheRoom303 "say Lisa: What kind of drugs, Denny?"
alias TheRoom304 "say Denny: It doesn’t matter, I don’t have them anymore."
alias TheRoom305 "say Claudette: It doesn’t matter? How in the hell did you get involved with drugs? What are you, giving them to him, selling them to him? Where the hell did you meet that man?"
alias TheRoom306 "say Lisa: What kind of drugs do you take?!"
alias TheRoom307 "say Denny: It’s nothing like that!"
alias TheRoom308 "say Lisa: What the hell is wrong with you?!"
alias TheRoom309 "say Denny: I just needed some money to pay off some stuff."
alias TheRoom310 "say Lisa: How much do you have to give him?"

alias TheRoom313 "say Denny: Stop ganging up on me!"
alias TheRoom314 "say Claudette: Well it is time somebody ganged up on you, for god’s sake! A man like that! Where in the hell did you meet a man like that?"
alias TheRoom315 "say Denny: It doesn’t matter!"
alias TheRoom316 "say Claudette: It matters a great deal! A man holds a gun on you, you almost got killed, you expect me to forget that happened?"
alias TheRoom317 "say Denny: You’re not my fucking mother!"
alias TheRoom318 "say Claudette: You listen to me, boy!"
alias TheRoom319 "say Lisa: No!"
alias TheRoom320 "say Claudette: Somebody had better do something around here."

alias TheRoom347 "say Mark: Is Johnny there?"
alias TheRoom348 "say Lisa: He’s in the shower."
alias TheRoom349 "say Mark: I don’t understand you. Why do you do things like this?"
alias TheRoom350 "say Lisa: Because I love you. You just don’t care, do you?"
alias TheRoom351 "say Mark: I do care. But we agreed, it’s over between us."
alias TheRoom352 "say Lisa: I understand, it’s our secret. But I still have feelings for you. You just don’t care."
alias TheRoom353 "say Mark: I do care!"

alias TheRoom356 "say Lisa: Okay, bye."
alias TheRoom357 "say They hang up."
alias TheRoom358 "say Cut to the roof. Johnny enters, mid-sentence."
alias TheRoom359 "say Johnny: I did not hit her! It’s not true! It’s bullshit! I did not hit her! I did not! (he throws a water bottle to the floor) Oh, hi Mark."
alias TheRoom360 "say Mark: (holding a football) Oh hey Johnny, what’s up?"
alias TheRoom361 "say Johnny: I have a problem with Lisa. She says that I hit her."
alias TheRoom362 "say Mark: What? Well did you?"
alias TheRoom363 "say Johnny: No, it’s not true! Don’t even ask! What’s new with you?"
alias TheRoom364 "say Mark: Well I’m just sitting up here thinking, you know? I got a question for you."
alias TheRoom365 "say Johnny: Yeah."
alias TheRoom366 "say Mark: You think girls like to cheat like guys do?"
alias TheRoom367 "say Johnny: What makes you say that?"
alias TheRoom368 "say Mark: I dunno. I dunno, I’m just, I’m just thinking."
alias TheRoom369 "say Johnny: I don’t have to worry about that because Lisa is loyal to me."
alias TheRoom370 "say Mark: Yeah man, you never know. People are very strange these days. I used to know a girl, she had a dozen guys. One of them found out about it, beat her up so bad she ended up in a hospital on Guerrero Street."
alias TheRoom371 "say Johnny: A-ha-ha-ha! What a story, Mark!"
alias TheRoom372 "say Mark: Yeah, you can say that again."
alias TheRoom373 "say Johnny: I’m so happy I have you as my best friend, and I love Lisa so much."

alias TheRoom375 "say Johnny: Well maybe you should have a girl, Mark."
alias TheRoom376 "say Mark: Yeah. Yeah, maybe you’re right. Maybe I have one already. I don’t know yet."
alias TheRoom377 "say Johnny: Well, what happened? Remember Betty? That’s her name?"
alias TheRoom378 "say Mark: Betty?"
alias TheRoom379 "say Johnny: Yeah."
alias TheRoom380 "say Mark: Yeah, we don’t see each other anymore. You know, she wasn’t any good in bed. She was beautiful, but we had too many arguments."
alias TheRoom381 "say Johnny: That’s too bad. My Lisa is great when I can get it."
alias TheRoom382 "say Mark: Oh, man, I just can’t figure women out. Sometimes they’re just too smart, sometimes they’re just flat-out stupid, other times they’re just evil."
alias TheRoom383 "say Johnny: It seems to me like you’re the expert, Mark!"
alias TheRoom384 "say Mark: No. Definitely not an expert, Johnny."
alias TheRoom385 "say Johnny: What’s bothering you, Mark?"

alias TheRoom396 "say Denny: What’s wrong with Mark?"
alias TheRoom397 "say Johnny: He’s cranky today. A-ha-ha-ha. Girl trouble, I guess. What’s new with you?"
alias TheRoom398 "say Denny: Not much. Still going to the movie tonight?"
alias TheRoom399 "say Johnny: Sure, we are."
alias TheRoom400 "say Denny: What kind of movie are we going to see?"
alias TheRoom401 "say Johnny: Well we’ll see… Denny, don’t plan too much. It may not come out right."

alias TheRoom403 "say Johnny: Okay."
alias TheRoom404 "say They proceed to play short-distance catch with the football while talking."
alias TheRoom405 "say Denny: Gotta tell you about something."
alias TheRoom406 "say Johnny: Shoot, Denny."
alias TheRoom407 "say Denny: It’s about Lisa."
alias TheRoom408 "say Johnny: Go on."
alias TheRoom409 "say Denny: She’s beautiful. She looks great in a red dress. I think I’m in love with her."
alias TheRoom410 "say Johnny: Go on."
alias TheRoom411 "say Denny: I know she doesn’t like me because sometimes she’s mean to me, but sometimes when I’m around her, I feel like I want to kiss her and tell her I love her. I don’t know. I’m just confused."
alias TheRoom412 "say Johnny: Denny, don’t worry about that. Lisa loves you too. As a person, as a human being, as a friend. You know people don’t have to say it. They can feel it."
alias TheRoom413 "say Denny: What do you mean?"
alias TheRoom414 "say Johnny: You can love someone deep inside your heart, and there is nothing wrong with it. If a lot of people loved each other, the world would be a better place to live."
alias TheRoom415 "say Denny: Lisa’s your future wife!"
alias TheRoom416 "say Johnny: Denny, don’t worry about it. You are part of our family, and we love you very much. And we will help you anytime. And Lisa loves you too. As a friend. You are sort of like her son."
alias TheRoom417 "say Denny: You mean you’re not upset with me?"
alias TheRoom418 "say Johnny: No, because I trust you and I trust Lisa. What about Elizabeth, hunh?"
alias TheRoom419 "say Denny: Well… I love her."
alias TheRoom420 "say Johnny: M-hm."
alias TheRoom421 "say Denny: When I graduate from college, get a good job, I want to marry her and have kids with her."
alias TheRoom422 "say Johnny: That’s the idea."
alias TheRoom423 "say Denny: You’re right. Thanks for paying my tuition."
alias TheRoom424 "say Johnny: You’re very welcome, Denny, and keep in mind, if you have any problems, talk to me, and I will help you."
alias TheRoom425 "say Denny: Awesome. Thanks, Johnny."
alias TheRoom426 "say Johnny: Let’s go eat, hunh? Come on, let’s go. Let’s go. I’m starving."
alias TheRoom427 "say They exit."
alias TheRoom428 "say Cut to an exterior panning shot of the Golden Gate Bridge."
alias TheRoom429 "say Cut to the room, where Michelle and Lisa are talking. Lisa’s neck is bulging throughout this scene, which means very few people have ever heard the dialogue."
alias TheRoom430 "say Michelle: So how’s Johnny?"
alias TheRoom431 "say Lisa: He didn’t get his promotion."
alias TheRoom432 "say Michelle: Is he disappointed?"
alias TheRoom433 "say Lisa: Quite a bit. He got drunk last night. And he hit me."
alias TheRoom434 "say Michelle: He hit you?!"
alias TheRoom435 "say Lisa: He didn’t know what he was doing."
alias TheRoom436 "say Michelle: Are you okay?"
alias TheRoom437 "say Lisa: Well, I don’t want to marry him anymore."
alias TheRoom438 "say Michelle: What?!"
alias TheRoom439 "say Lisa: Johnny’s okay. But I found somebody else."
alias TheRoom440 "say Michelle: Lisa! This isn’t right. You’re living with one guy and you’re sleeping with another guy?"
alias TheRoom441 "say Lisa: I’m doing what I want to do."
alias TheRoom442 "say Michelle: Well who is he?"
alias TheRoom443 "say Lisa: His best friend. And he lives in this building."
alias TheRoom444 "say Michelle: I can’t believe you’re telling me this. It’s Mark, isn’t it? Lisa, you know, you’re just thinking about yourself. Somebody’s going to get hurt. You’ve got to be honest with Johnny."
alias TheRoom445 "say Lisa: I can’t do that. He would be devastated."
alias TheRoom446 "say Michelle: Well, if you care so much for him, why cheat on him?"
alias TheRoom447 "say Lisa: Look, I really don’t know what to do. I love Mark. I don’t have any more feelings for Johnny."
alias TheRoom448 "say Michelle: Johnny’s so excited about this wedding."
alias TheRoom449 "say Lisa: I know."
alias TheRoom450 "say Michelle: You’ve got to tell Johnny."
alias TheRoom451 "say Lisa: No guilt-trips."
alias TheRoom452 "say Michelle: You don’t feel guilty about this at all."
alias TheRoom453 "say Lisa: No. I’m happy."
alias TheRoom454 "say Michelle: Something awful is going to happen."
alias TheRoom455 "say Lisa: Please don’t tell anybody."
alias TheRoom456 "say Cut to exterior shot of the house. Johnny is approaching. He picks up the paper."
alias TheRoom457 "say Cut to the room."

alias TheRoom460 "say Johnny: Hello Michelle. I heard you. What secret?"
alias TheRoom461 "say Lisa: It’s between us women."
alias TheRoom462 "say Michelle: Hi Johnny."
alias TheRoom463 "say Johnny: Did you get a new dress?"
alias TheRoom464 "say Michelle: Um… well, I guess I better be going. I’ll just talk to you guys later?"
alias TheRoom465 "say Lisa: Excuse me."
alias TheRoom466 "say Michelle: Lisa, remember what I told you."
alias TheRoom467 "say Michelle exits."
alias TheRoom468 "say Johnny: What’s she talking about?"
alias TheRoom469 "say Lisa: It’s girl talk. I just told you that."
alias TheRoom470 "say Johnny: I never hit you. You shouldn’t have any secrets from me. I’m your future husband."
alias TheRoom471 "say Lisa: You sure about that? Maybe I’ll change my mind."
alias TheRoom472 "say Johnny: Don’t talk like that. What do you mean?"
alias TheRoom473 "say Lisa: What do you think? Women change their minds all the time."
alias TheRoom474 "say Johnny: A-ha-ha-ha. You must be kidding, aren’t you?"
alias TheRoom475 "say Lisa: Look, I don’t want to talk about it. I’m going to go upstairs, and wash up, and go to bed."
alias TheRoom476 "say Johnny: (shoving Lisa down onto the couch) How dare you talk to me like that! You should tell me everything!"
alias TheRoom477 "say Lisa: I can’t talk right now."
alias TheRoom478 "say Johnny: Why Lisa, why Lisa, please talk to me, please! You’re part of my life, you are everything, I could not go on without you, Lisa."
alias TheRoom479 "say Lisa: You’re scaring me."
alias TheRoom480 "say Johnny: You’re lying, I never hit you. You are tearing me apart, Lisa!"
alias TheRoom481 "say Lisa: Why are you so hysterical?!"
alias TheRoom482 "say Johnny: Do you understand life? Do you?"
alias TheRoom483 "say Lisa gets up and heads upstairs."
alias TheRoom484 "say Lisa: Don’t worry about it. Everything will be alright."
alias TheRoom485 "say Johnny: You drive me crazy."
alias TheRoom486 "say Lisa: Goodnight, Johnny."
alias TheRoom487 "say Johnny: Don’t worry about it. I still love you. Goodnight, Lisa."
alias TheRoom488 "say Cut to a long tracking shot of the Golden Gate Bridge."

alias TheRoom490 "say Mike: Hey, what’s going on, man?"
alias TheRoom491 "say Johnny: Oh hi, Mike, what’s new?"
alias TheRoom492 "say Mike: Um, actually, Johnny, I got, I got a little bit of a tragedy on my hands, yeah. Me and Michelle, we were, we were making out, uh, at your place…"
alias TheRoom493 "say Johnny: A-ha-ha."
alias TheRoom494 "say Mike: …and, uh, Lisa and Claudette sort of, uh, walked in on us in the middle of it. That’s not the end of the story."
alias TheRoom495 "say Johnny: Go on, I’m listening."
alias TheRoom496 "say Mike: Okay. We’re going at it, and um, I get out of there as fast as possible, you know, I get my pants, I get my shirt, and I get out of there. And then about halfway down the stairs, I realize that I have misplaced, I’ve forgotten something. Um, my underwear."
alias TheRoom497 "say They both chuckle."
alias TheRoom498 "say Mike: So I come back to get it, I pretend that I need a book, you know, I’m like looking for my book, and then I reach and put the underwear in my pocket, sort of slide out real quick. Well Claudette, she saw it sticking out of my pocket, so she pulls it out, and she’s, uh, showing everybody me underwears."
alias TheRoom499 "say Johnny: You must be kidding. Underwear, I got the picture."
alias TheRoom500 "say Mike: Yeah, I dunno what…"
alias TheRoom501 "say Johnny: That’s life."
alias TheRoom502 "say Mike: Nah."
alias TheRoom503 "say Johnny: Yeah."

alias TheRoom509 "say Denny: Oh, pshhh, come on!"
alias TheRoom510 "say Johnny: Come on, it’s good for you, come on."
alias TheRoom511 "say Mike: Alright, whatever, whatever."
alias TheRoom512 "say Johnny: Let’s go for it."
alias TheRoom513 "say Mike: I’m going out."
alias TheRoom514 "say They proceed to toss the football around in close quarters, like you do."
alias TheRoom515 "say Mike: Yeah, sorry you had to see that."
alias TheRoom516 "say Denny: I’m not sorry! (gibberish) Studying, right? (more gibberish) I don’t study like that."
alias TheRoom517 "say Johnny: He doesn’t."
alias TheRoom518 "say Mark enters."
alias TheRoom519 "say Mark: Hey, Denny, what’s up?"
alias TheRoom520 "say Denny: Hey, what’s up, Mark?"
alias TheRoom521 "say Johnny: Hi Mark."
alias TheRoom522 "say Denny: Catch it, come on, man."
alias TheRoom523 "say Mike: Not much."
alias TheRoom524 "say Denny: He’s just telling us about an underwear issue he had."
alias TheRoom525 "say Mike: No, don’t…"
alias TheRoom526 "say Mark: Underwear? What’s that?"
alias TheRoom527 "say Mike: It’s embarrassing, man, I don’t want to get into it."
alias TheRoom528 "say Mark: Underwear? Man, come on…"
alias TheRoom529 "say Mark inexplicably shoves Mike into a trashcan."
alias TheRoom530 "say Mike: Oh, God!"
alias TheRoom531 "say Denny: You okay? Are you okay?"
alias TheRoom532 "say Mike: Yeah, I’m fine!"
alias TheRoom533 "say Denny: Are you sure?"
alias TheRoom534 "say Mike: Yeah, uh-huh."
alias TheRoom535 "say Denny: Do you need to see a doctor?"
alias TheRoom536 "say Mike: No, no, I’m tough. I’m good, I’m alright, I’m fine."
alias TheRoom537 "say Johnny: Mark, why don’t you take him home? And Mike, listen, if you need anything, call me anytime, alright? Are you alright?"
alias TheRoom538 "say Mike: Yeah."

alias TheRoom544 "say Lisa: You look really tired today, mom. Are you feeling okay?"
alias TheRoom545 "say Claudette: I didn’t get much sleep last night."
alias TheRoom546 "say Lisa: Why not?"
alias TheRoom547 "say Claudette: You remember my friend Shirley Hamilton?"
alias TheRoom548 "say Lisa: Uh-huh."
alias TheRoom549 "say Claudette: She wants to buy a new house, and so I asked Johnny if he could help her with the down payment. All he can tell me is it’s an awkward situation. I expected your husband to be a little more generous."
alias TheRoom550 "say Lisa: He’s not my husband."
alias TheRoom551 "say Claudette: I know, but Johnny is part of our family."
alias TheRoom552 "say Lisa: Mom, I don’t love Johnny anymore. I don’t even like him. I had sex with someone else."
alias TheRoom553 "say Claudette: You can’t be serious."
alias TheRoom554 "say We see that Johnny is listening from the staircase."
alias TheRoom555 "say Lisa: You don’t understand."
alias TheRoom556 "say Claudette: Who? Who is it?"
alias TheRoom557 "say Lisa: I don’t want to talk about it."
alias TheRoom558 "say Claudette: You don’t want to talk about it. Then why did you bring it up in the first place?"
alias TheRoom559 "say Lisa: I don’t know."
alias TheRoom560 "say Claudette: You don’t know. If you think I’m tired today, wait till you see me tomorrow."
alias TheRoom561 "say Lisa: Are you coming to the party?"
alias TheRoom562 "say Claudette: Sure. I suppose so."
alias TheRoom563 "say They exit."
alias TheRoom564 "say Johnny: How can they say this about me? I don’t believe it. I show them. I will record everything."
alias TheRoom565 "say Johnny descends the staircase and tediously installs a primitive tape recorder under the phone, then exits upstairs."
alias TheRoom566 "say Cut to the room, where Johnny and Peter are talking."
alias TheRoom567 "say Johnny: I don’t understand women. Do you, Peter?"
alias TheRoom568 "say Peter: (laughs) What man does? What’s the problem?"
alias TheRoom569 "say Johnny: They never say what they mean, and they always play games."
alias TheRoom570 "say Peter: Okay… um… what do you mean?"
alias TheRoom571 "say Johnny: I have a serious problem with Lisa. Um, I don’t think she’s faithful to me. In fact I know she isn’t."
alias TheRoom572 "say Peter: Lisa? Are you sure?"
alias TheRoom573 "say Johnny: Yeah I’m sure, I overheard a conversation between Lisa and her mother. What should I do, Peter?"
alias TheRoom574 "say Peter: This is Lisa we’re talking about?"
alias TheRoom575 "say Johnny: Yeah."
alias TheRoom576 "say Peter: I don’t know what to say."
alias TheRoom577 "say Johnny: But you’re a psychologist. Do you have some advice?"
alias TheRoom578 "say Peter: It’s a complicated situation, Johnny. I mean you’re my friend. I don’t want to get between you and Lisa. Look. If you want to, you should confront her."
alias TheRoom579 "say Johnny: I can’t confront her! I want to give her a second chance, after all, she’s my future wife. You know what they say: “love is blind.”"
alias TheRoom580 "say Peter: You’ve got a lot of faith in Lisa. Sometimes, life gets complicated. The unexpected can happen. When it does, you just gotta deal with it."
alias TheRoom581 "say The doorbell rings."
alias TheRoom582 "say Peter: Did you hear the door?"
alias TheRoom583 "say Johnny: Yeah. (answers the door) Oh hi, Mark. Come in."
alias TheRoom584 "say Mark enters."
alias TheRoom585 "say Mark: Oh, hey, Johnny. Hey Peter!"
alias TheRoom586 "say Johnny: We’re just talking about women."
alias TheRoom587 "say Mark: (long pause) Women, man. Women just confuse me. Ahhh. I have a girl. She’s married, I mean she’s very attractive, it’s driving me crazy."
alias TheRoom588 "say Peter: Why didn’t you mention this before? Is it anyone I know?"
alias TheRoom589 "say Mark: Nah man, you don’t know her."
alias TheRoom590 "say Johnny: Can I meet her?"
alias TheRoom591 "say Mark: I don’t think so. It’s an awkward situation."
alias TheRoom592 "say Johnny: You mean she’s too old, or you think I will take her away from you? Hunh?"
alias TheRoom593 "say Peter: (laughs)"
alias TheRoom594 "say Mark: (laughs) No."
alias TheRoom595 "say Johnny: I have my own problems."
alias TheRoom596 "say Peter: Tell me about your problems, Johnny."
alias TheRoom597 "say Johnny: Peter, you always play psychologist with us!"
alias TheRoom598 "say Peter: Look, I’m just your friend, and I’m just worried about you."
alias TheRoom599 "say Johnny: Lisa is teasing me about whether we are going to get married or not. And we didn’t make love in a while. And I don’t know what to do."
alias TheRoom600 "say Peter: You never really know. I mean, look, you should tell her about your feelings, okay? You shouldn’t hide them. You two have been together forever. You can work out anything as long as you talk about it."
alias TheRoom601 "say Johnny: Not always!"
alias TheRoom602 "say Peter: People are people. Sometimes they just can’t see their own faults."
alias TheRoom603 "say Mark: Hey, I’m thinking of moving to a bigger place, man, I’m making some good money."
alias TheRoom604 "say Peter: Look. You should tell her the truth. I mean you’re doing this for your girl, right?"
alias TheRoom605 "say Johnny: You’re right, Peter. Ha-ha. Is she getting a divorce, Mark?"
alias TheRoom606 "say Mark: (laughs) You guys are too much. Hey are you running, uh, Bay to Breakers this year?"
alias TheRoom607 "say Johnny: I am, sure."
alias TheRoom608 "say Peter: I’m not doing it this year."
alias TheRoom609 "say Johnny: Ha-ha-ha, chicken, Peter, you’re just a little chicken! Cheep, cheep cheep cheep cheep chee-ee-ee-eep eeeeeeeeeeee!"
alias TheRoom610 "say Peter: Who are you calling a chicken? I just don’t like all the weirdos, there’s too many weirdos there."
alias TheRoom611 "say Johnny: (incomprehensible gibberish) I don’t mind. Mark, do you remember the one with big tits, the blondie one?"
alias TheRoom612 "say Mark: How about the one with the bridal gown with the sign?"
alias TheRoom613 "say Johnny: Ha-ha yeah, “can you marry me?”, ha-ha, I thought I would take her up on it, ha-ha."
alias TheRoom614 "say Mark: I never ate so much."
alias TheRoom615 "say Johnny: Yeah, the barbecue chicken was delicious, rice, that was cool."
alias TheRoom616 "say Peter: You guys proved my point. You’re both weird. You guys want to play cards?"
alias TheRoom617 "say Johnny: No we can’t. I expect Lisa any minute."
alias TheRoom618 "say Mark: Hey come on, man, who’s the king of the house?"
alias TheRoom619 "say Peter: Yeah, you’ve got to establish these guidelines before you get married. Speaking of, how’d you ever meet Lisa? You never told us."
alias TheRoom620 "say Johnny: Well that’s a very interesting story, when I moved to San Francisco with two suitcases and I didn’t know anyone and I have, uh, I head to YMCA with a $2000 check which I could not cash."
alias TheRoom621 "say Mark: Why not?"
alias TheRoom622 "say Johnny: Well because it was an out of state bank. Anyway, uh, I was working as a busboy in a hotel, and uh, uh, she was sitting, drinking her coffee, and she was so beautiful, and I say hi to her. That’s how we met."
alias TheRoom623 "say Mark: So, I mean, what’s the interesting part?"
alias TheRoom624 "say Johnny: Well the interesting part is that on our first date, she paid for dinner."
alias TheRoom625 "say Mark: What? No tips from your job?"
alias TheRoom626 "say Johnny: Whatever. Do you guys want to eat something?"
alias TheRoom627 "say Johnny exits to the kitchen. Lisa enters."
alias TheRoom628 "say Lisa: Hi guys. What’s going on?"
alias TheRoom629 "say Mark: Oh, hey Lisa."
alias TheRoom630 "say Peter: Hi Lisa."
alias TheRoom631 "say Denny materializes behind Lisa, then proceeds to stare out the window for some reason."
alias TheRoom632 "say Lisa: Where’s Johnny?"
alias TheRoom633 "say Mark: In the kitchen. I gotta go."
alias TheRoom634 "say Lisa: I didn’t mean to chase you off. You should stick around for a while."
alias TheRoom635 "say Mark: I gotta work early. See ya."
alias TheRoom636 "say Mark exits. Peter also exits. Denny crouches to the floor. Lisa also crouches to the floor."
alias TheRoom637 "say Denny: Did you get your wedding gown yet?"
alias TheRoom638 "say Lisa: No. I’ve got plenty of time."
alias TheRoom639 "say Denny: Are you sure you have plenty of time? It’s only a month away."
alias TheRoom640 "say Lisa: It’ll be fine. What are you so worried about? Everything’s okay."
alias TheRoom641 "say Denny: Johnny doesn’t seem very excited. Is there a problem?"
alias TheRoom642 "say Lisa: There’s no problem. Why do you ask?"
alias TheRoom643 "say Denny: I just want you and Johnny to be happy."
alias TheRoom644 "say They both stand up."
alias TheRoom645 "say Lisa: I am happy. Look, Denny, I need to talk to Johnny. Okay? I’ll see you later."
alias TheRoom646 "say Denny: Okay. Tell him I said hello?"

alias TheRoom678 "say Peter: How the hell did you let this happen?"
alias TheRoom679 "say Mark: Fuck!"
alias TheRoom680 "say Peter: You know this is going to ruin your friendship with Johnny? What were you thinking? Alright, you want my advice? Sometimes, life can get complicated, and you’ve got to be responsible. So you don’t see Lisa again, and you definitely don’t sleep with her again! Just find yourself another girl. She’s a sociopath! She only cares about herself. She can’t love anyone."

alias TheRoom793 "say Johnny: Good."
alias TheRoom794 "say They run side by side tossing the football in the park. There’s barely audible and completely uninteresting dialogue. They say “what’s new with you” a lot. Johnny wrestles Mark to the ground."
alias TheRoom795 "say Cut to a shot of the San Francisco skyline."
alias TheRoom796 "say Cut to the room, where Lisa is sweeping. The doorbell rings."

alias TheRoom799 "say Lisa: Come on in."
alias TheRoom800 "say Mark enters."
alias TheRoom801 "say Lisa: Hey Mark."
alias TheRoom802 "say Mark: Wow, so, uh, you gonna be ready?"

alias TheRoom835 "say Lisa: No. Mark’s his best friend."
alias TheRoom836 "say Michelle: Tricky tricky."
alias TheRoom837 "say Lisa: You know, I really loved Johnny at first. Everything’s changed. I need more from life than what Johnny can give me. Suddenly my eyes are wide open and I can see everything so clearly. I want it all."
alias TheRoom838 "say Michelle: You think you can get it all from Mark?"
alias TheRoom839 "say Lisa: If he can’t give me what I want, somebody else will."
alias TheRoom840 "say Michelle: Lisa, you’re sounding just like your mother. You’re being so manipulative."
alias TheRoom841 "say Lisa: So what? You can learn something from me. You have to take as much as you can. You have to live, live, live. Don’t worry about me. I have everything covered."
alias TheRoom842 "say Michelle: Your point of view is so different from mine."
alias TheRoom843 "say Lisa: Look. I don’t want to talk about it. People are going to be getting here soon and we have to finish."
alias TheRoom844 "say Michelle: Lisa!"
alias TheRoom845 "say Lisa: I don’t see what the big deal is. Doesn’t everybody look out for number one? Don’t I deserve the best?"

alias TheRoom860 "say Mark: Well when can we meet about that?"
alias TheRoom861 "say Johnny: Well, we can talk about this tomorrow."

alias TheRoom878 "say Lisa: I’m fixing the apartment for Johnny’s birthday, but I’m really not into it."
alias TheRoom879 "say Claudette: Oh, why not?"
alias TheRoom880 "say Lisa: Because I’m in love with Mark, not Johnny. And here I am, planning his party."
alias TheRoom881 "say Claudette: It’s not right, Lisa. I still think you should marry Johnny. Now you can’t live on love. You need financial security."
alias TheRoom882 "say Lisa: But I’m not happy! He still thinks I’m gonna marry him next month. He’s a fool."
alias TheRoom883 "say Claudette: You expect to be happy. I haven’t been happy since I married my first husband. I didn’t even want to marry your father."
alias TheRoom884 "say Lisa: You never told me that!"
alias TheRoom885 "say Claudette: Well it’s true. All men are assholes. Men and women use and abuse each other all the time, there’s nothing wrong with it. Marriage has nothing to do with love."
alias TheRoom886 "say Lisa: Johnny’s okay, I suppose. Actually, I have him wrapped around my little finger."
alias TheRoom887 "say Claudette: Well, you should be happy then."
alias TheRoom888 "say Lisa: But I don’t love him!"
alias TheRoom889 "say Claudette: Don’t throw your life away just because you don’t love him! That’s ridiculous! You need to grow up. And you need to listen to me."
alias TheRoom890 "say Lisa: Okay, mom, I’ll see you at the party. I just need to be alone right now."
alias TheRoom891 "say Claudette: Bye bye, my precious."

alias TheRoom898 "say Cut to panning shot of the nighttime San Francisco skyline."
alias TheRoom899 "say Cut to the party, where various characters and non-characters are engaged in fake conversations. Johnny and Claudette are discussing something. Lisa is flirting with Steven, a character we’ve never seen before who is actually a last-minute replacement for Peter. Mark is watching them. Lisa and Mark exchange flirty looks. Johnny seems concerned. Mike and Michelle are flirting with another couple. Michelle and Mike start feeding each other cake."

alias TheRoom901 "say Everybody exits except for Lisa and Mark."
alias TheRoom902 "say Lisa: Wait. I have something I want to show you."

alias TheRoom911 "say They make out some more. Steven enters."
alias TheRoom912 "say Steven: What’s going on here?"
alias TheRoom913 "say They bolt upright."
alias TheRoom914 "say Steven: Why are you doing this?"
alias TheRoom915 "say Lisa: I love him."
alias TheRoom916 "say Steven: I don’t believe it."
alias TheRoom917 "say Mark: You don’t understand anything, man. Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!"
alias TheRoom918 "say Mark exits."
alias TheRoom919 "say Steven: Do you understand what you’re doing? You’re going to destroy Johnny. He’s very sensitive."
alias TheRoom920 "say Lisa: I don’t care. I’m in love with Mark."
alias TheRoom921 "say Steven: How can you do this? You make me sick."
alias TheRoom922 "say Johnny and Michelle enter."
alias TheRoom923 "say Johnny: Thank you, honey. This is a beautiful party. You invited all my friends. Good thinking!"
alias TheRoom924 "say Lisa: You’re welcome, darling. You know how much I love you."
alias TheRoom925 "say Johnny: I do. Ha-ha-ha."

alias TheRoom934 "say Steven: I agree with that."
alias TheRoom935 "say Lisa: Look, I’m gonna tell him, okay? I just, I don’t want to ruin his birthday."
alias TheRoom936 "say Steven: When is the baby due?"
alias TheRoom937 "say Lisa: There is no baby."
alias TheRoom938 "say Steven and Michelle: What?!"
alias TheRoom939 "say Steven: What are you talking about?"
alias TheRoom940 "say Lisa: I told him that to make it interesting. We’re probably going to have a baby eventually anyway. You’re not going to tell Johnny, are you?"
alias TheRoom941 "say Michelle: Lisa, are you feeling okay? Because this is just getting worse and worse."
alias TheRoom942 "say Steven: I feel like I’m sitting on an atomic bomb waiting for it to go off."
alias TheRoom943 "say Michelle: Me too. There’s no simple solution to this."
alias TheRoom944 "say Lisa: Don’t worry. You guys worry entirely too much about me."
alias TheRoom945 "say Michelle: Lisa, we’re not worried about you. We’re worried about Johnny. You don’t understand the psychological impact of what you’re doing here. You’re hurting yourself. You’re hurting our friendship."
alias TheRoom946 "say Lisa: I am not responsible for Johnny. I’m through with that. I’m changing. I have the right, don’t I? People are changing all the time. I have to think about my future. What’s it to you?"
alias TheRoom947 "say Steven: This is going to pull us all down. It’s going to shake up our group of friends. It’s going to destroy our friendship, Lisa. I don’t think Mark really loves you."
alias TheRoom948 "say Lisa: I don’t want to talk about it!"
alias TheRoom949 "say Michelle: Lisa, you’re going to have to face it. I for one am going to have a hard time forgiving you if you don’t."

alias TheRoom981 "say Johnny: (attacking Mark) Since when do you give me orders?"
alias TheRoom982 "say Mark: Since Lisa changed her mind about you. Wake up, man, what planet are you on?"
alias TheRoom983 "say Johnny: I think you should leave right now, Mark."
alias TheRoom984 "say Lisa: Don’t spoil it, we were just having fun."
alias TheRoom985 "say Mark: Don’t worry about it, man."
