alias swIV10 "say "
alias swIV11 "say A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away..."
alias swIV12 "say A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. "
alias swIV13 "say War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls "
alias swIV14 "say into infinity."
alias swIV15 "say It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, "
alias swIV16 "say striking from a hidden base, have won their first "
alias swIV17 "say victory against the evil Galactic Empire."
alias swIV18 "say During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal "
alias swIV19 "say secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the "
alias swIV20 "say Death Star, an armored space station with enough "
alias swIV21 "say power to destroy an entire planet."
alias swIV22 "say Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess "
alias swIV23 "say Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of "
alias swIV24 "say the stolen plans that can save her people and "
alias swIV25 "say restore freedom to the galaxy..."
alias swIV26 "say The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total "
alias swIV27 "say eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny "
alias swIV28 "say silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers "
alias swIV29 "say from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed "
alias swIV30 "say by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly "
alias swIV31 "say laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing "
alias swIV32 "say the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate."
alias swIV33 "say INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY"
alias swIV34 "say An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-"
alias swIV35 "say D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way "
alias swIV36 "say through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are "
alias swIV37 "say old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His "
alias swIV38 "say face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. "
alias swIV39 "say Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of "
alias swIV40 "say human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic "
alias swIV41 "say surface of an Art Deco design."
alias swIV42 "say Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way."
alias swIV43 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV44 "say Did you hear that? They've shut down "
alias swIV45 "say the main reactor. We'll be destroyed "
alias swIV46 "say for sure. This is madness!"
alias swIV47 "say Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in "
alias swIV48 "say the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door."
alias swIV49 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV50 "say We're doomed!"
alias swIV51 "say The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that "
alias swIV52 "say only another robot could understand."
alias swIV53 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV54 "say There'll be no escape for the Princess "
alias swIV55 "say this time."
alias swIV56 "say Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as "
alias swIV57 "say loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment "
alias swIV58 "say are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship."
alias swIV59 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV60 "say What's that?"
alias swIV61 "say EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE"
alias swIV62 "say The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade "
alias swIV63 "say Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the "
alias swIV64 "say underside dock of the giant Imperial starship."
alias swIV65 "say INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER"
alias swIV66 "say The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a "
alias swIV67 "say tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and "
alias swIV68 "say a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make "
alias swIV69 "say their way into the smoke-filled corridor."
alias swIV70 "say In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with "
alias swIV71 "say laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns "
alias swIV72 "say creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck "
alias swIV73 "say behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers "
alias swIV74 "say who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered "
alias swIV75 "say arms and faces."
alias swIV76 "say An explosion hits near the robots."
alias swIV77 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV78 "say I should have known better than to "
alias swIV79 "say trust the logic of a half-sized "
alias swIV80 "say thermocapsulary dehousing assister..."
alias swIV81 "say Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages "
alias swIV82 "say around the two hapless robots."
alias swIV83 "say EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY"
alias swIV84 "say A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. "
alias swIV85 "say The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone "
alias swIV86 "say figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations "
alias swIV87 "say who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy "
alias swIV88 "say hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable "
alias swIV89 "say lad with a prize-winning smile."
alias swIV90 "say A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a "
alias swIV91 "say large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the "
alias swIV92 "say desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided "
alias swIV93 "say by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot "
alias swIV94 "say appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.  "
alias swIV95 "say A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and "
alias swIV96 "say he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his "
alias swIV97 "say utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying "
alias swIV98 "say the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired "
alias swIV99 "say Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet "
alias swIV100 "say above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the "
alias swIV101 "say tiny robot to follow him."
alias swIV102 "say LUKE"
alias swIV103 "say Hurry up! Come with me! What are you "
alias swIV104 "say waiting for?! Get in gear!"
alias swIV105 "say The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and "
alias swIV106 "say smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his "
alias swIV107 "say arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps "
alias swIV108 "say into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum "
alias swIV109 "say madly."
alias swIV110 "say INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY"
alias swIV111 "say The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his "
alias swIV112 "say way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is "
alias swIV113 "say Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured "
alias swIV114 "say by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which "
alias swIV115 "say stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the "
alias swIV116 "say Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away "
alias swIV117 "say from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through "
alias swIV118 "say the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run "
alias swIV119 "say in a frenzied panic."
alias swIV120 "say INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER"
alias swIV121 "say A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.  "
alias swIV122 "say Artoo makes beeping sounds."
alias swIV123 "say INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER"
alias swIV124 "say Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is "
alias swIV125 "say nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel "
alias swIV126 "say soldiers can be heard in the distance."
alias swIV127 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV128 "say Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?"
alias swIV129 "say A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and "
alias swIV130 "say he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-"
alias swIV131 "say filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years "
alias swIV132 "say old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, "
alias swIV133 "say dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting "
alias swIV134 "say something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little "
alias swIV135 "say robot joins his companion."
alias swIV136 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV137 "say At last! Where have you been?"
alias swIV138 "say Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance."
alias swIV139 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV140 "say They're heading in this direction. "
alias swIV141 "say What are we going to do? We'll be "
alias swIV142 "say sent to the spice mine of Kessel or "
alias swIV143 "say smashed into who knows what!"
alias swIV144 "say Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the "
alias swIV145 "say subhallway. Threepio chases after him."
alias swIV146 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV147 "say Wait a minute, where are you going?"
alias swIV148 "say Artoo responds with electronic beeps."
alias swIV149 "say INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR"
alias swIV150 "say The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies "
alias swIV151 "say of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as "
alias swIV152 "say an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord."
alias swIV153 "say IMPERIAL OFFICER"
alias swIV154 "say The Death Star plans are not in the "
alias swIV155 "say main computer."
alias swIV156 "say Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles "
alias swIV157 "say in vain."
alias swIV158 "say VADER"
alias swIV159 "say Where are those transmissions you "
alias swIV160 "say intercepted?"
alias swIV161 "say Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat."
alias swIV162 "say VADER"
alias swIV163 "say What have you done with those plans?"
alias swIV164 "say REBEL OFFICER"
alias swIV165 "say We intercepted no transmissions. "
alias swIV166 "say Aaah... This is a consular ship. "
alias swIV167 "say Were on a diplomatic mission."
alias swIV168 "say VADER"
alias swIV169 "say If this is a consular ship... were "
alias swIV170 "say is the Ambassador?"
alias swIV171 "say The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the "
alias swIV172 "say Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a "
alias swIV173 "say gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp. "
alias swIV174 "say Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to "
alias swIV175 "say his troops."
alias swIV176 "say VADER"
alias swIV177 "say Commander, tear this ship apart until "
alias swIV178 "say you've found those plans and bring "
alias swIV179 "say me the Ambassador. I want her alive!"
alias swIV180 "say The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways."
alias swIV181 "say INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY"
alias swIV182 "say The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the "
alias swIV183 "say stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia "
alias swIV184 "say Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her "
alias swIV185 "say eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds "
alias swIV186 "say of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the "
alias swIV187 "say troopers spots her."
alias swIV188 "say TROOPER"
alias swIV189 "say There she is! Set for stun!"
alias swIV190 "say Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with "
alias swIV191 "say her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a "
alias swIV192 "say paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body."
alias swIV193 "say TROOPER"
alias swIV194 "say She'll be all right. Inform Lord "
alias swIV195 "say Vader we have a prisoner."
alias swIV196 "say INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY"
alias swIV197 "say Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. "
alias swIV198 "say He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light "
alias swIV199 "say begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into "
alias swIV200 "say the cramped four-man pod."
alias swIV201 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV202 "say Hey, you're not permitted in there. "
alias swIV203 "say It's restricted. You'll be deactivated "
alias swIV204 "say for sure.."
alias swIV205 "say Artoo beeps something to him."
alias swIV206 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV207 "say Don't call me a mindless philosopher, "
alias swIV208 "say you overweight glob of grease! Now "
alias swIV209 "say come out before somebody sees you."
alias swIV210 "say Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding "
alias swIV211 "say the mission he is about to perform."
alias swIV212 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV213 "say Secret mission? What plans? What are "
alias swIV214 "say you talking about? I'm not getting "
alias swIV215 "say in there!"
alias swIV216 "say Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps "
alias swIV217 "say and twangs angrily."
alias swIV218 "say A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris "
alias swIV219 "say through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and, "
alias swIV220 "say after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky "
alias swIV221 "say robot jumps into the lifepod."
alias swIV222 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV223 "say I'm going to regret this."
alias swIV224 "say INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER"
alias swIV225 "say On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified "
alias swIV226 "say robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft."
alias swIV227 "say CHIEF PILOT"
alias swIV228 "say There goes another one."
alias swIV229 "say CAPTAIN"
alias swIV230 "say Hold your fire. There are no life "
alias swIV231 "say forms. It must have been short-"
alias swIV232 "say circuited."
alias swIV233 "say INT. LIFEPOD"
alias swIV234 "say Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.  "
alias swIV235 "say Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy."
alias swIV236 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV237 "say That's funny, the damage doesn't "
alias swIV238 "say look as bad from out here."
alias swIV239 "say Artoo beeps an assuring response."
alias swIV240 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV241 "say Are you sure this things safe?"
alias swIV242 "say EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY"
alias swIV243 "say Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white "
alias swIV244 "say buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty "
alias swIV245 "say empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to "
alias swIV246 "say get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist "
alias swIV247 "say at Luke as he flies past."
alias swIV248 "say WOMAN"
alias swIV249 "say I've told you kids to slow down!"
alias swIV250 "say INT. POWER STATION - DAY"
alias swIV251 "say Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged "
alias swIV252 "say mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been "
alias swIV253 "say asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the "
alias swIV254 "say office, yelling wildly."
alias swIV255 "say FIXER"
alias swIV256 "say Did I hear a young noise blast through "
alias swIV257 "say here?"
alias swIV258 "say CAMIE"
alias swIV259 "say It was just wormie on another rampage."
alias swIV260 "say Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak "
alias swIV261 "say and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are "
alias swIV262 "say playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly, "
alias swIV263 "say handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy "
alias swIV264 "say city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics "
alias swIV265 "say of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the "
alias swIV266 "say background."
alias swIV267 "say LUKE"
alias swIV268 "say Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?"
alias swIV269 "say Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great "
alias swIV270 "say joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug."
alias swIV271 "say LUKE"
alias swIV272 "say I didn't know you were back! When "
alias swIV273 "say did you get in?"
alias swIV274 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV275 "say Just now. I wanted to surprise you, "
alias swIV276 "say hot shot. I thought you'd be here... "
alias swIV277 "say certainly didn't expect you to be "
alias swIV278 "say out working."
alias swIV279 "say (he laughs)"
alias swIV280 "say LUKE"
alias swIV281 "say The Academy didn't change you "
alias swIV282 "say much...but you're back so soon? Hey, "
alias swIV283 "say what happened, didn't you get your "
alias swIV284 "say commission?"
alias swIV285 "say Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony."
alias swIV286 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV287 "say Of course I got it. Signed aboard "
alias swIV288 "say The Rand Ecliptic last week. First "
alias swIV289 "say mate Biggs Darklighter at your "
alias swIV290 "say service..."
alias swIV291 "say (he salutes)"
alias swIV292 "say ...I just came to say good-bye to "
alias swIV293 "say all you unfortunate landlocked "
alias swIV294 "say simpletons."
alias swIV295 "say Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend "
alias swIV296 "say is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of "
alias swIV297 "say it."
alias swIV298 "say LUKE"
alias swIV299 "say I almost forgot. There's a battle "
alias swIV300 "say going on! Right here in our system. "
alias swIV301 "say Come and look!"
alias swIV302 "say DEAK"
alias swIV303 "say Not again! Forget it."
alias swIV304 "say EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - "
alias swIV305 "say DAY"
alias swIV306 "say The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie "
alias swIV307 "say and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. "
alias swIV308 "say Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens."
alias swIV309 "say LUKE"
alias swIV310 "say There they are!"
alias swIV311 "say Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to "
alias swIV312 "say see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars "
alias swIV313 "say Biggs sees two small silver specks."
alias swIV314 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV315 "say That's no battle, hot shot... they're "
alias swIV316 "say just sitting there! Probably a "
alias swIV317 "say freighter-tanker refueling."
alias swIV318 "say LUKE"
alias swIV319 "say But there was a lot of firing "
alias swIV320 "say earlier..."
alias swIV321 "say Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the "
alias swIV322 "say building in the process. Luke grabs them."
alias swIV323 "say LUKE"
alias swIV324 "say Hey, easy with those..."
alias swIV325 "say CAMIE"
alias swIV326 "say Don't worry about it, Wormie."
alias swIV327 "say The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs "
alias swIV328 "say his shoulders in resignation."
alias swIV329 "say FIXER"
alias swIV330 "say I keep telling you, the Rebellion is "
alias swIV331 "say a long way from here. I doubt if the "
alias swIV332 "say Empire would even fight to keep this "
alias swIV333 "say system. Believe me Luke, this planet "
alias swIV334 "say is a big hunk of nothing..."
alias swIV335 "say Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The "
alias swIV336 "say group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about "
alias swIV337 "say Luke's ineptitude."
alias swIV338 "say INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY"
alias swIV339 "say Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad "
alias swIV340 "say of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is "
alias swIV341 "say brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly "
alias swIV342 "say marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader "
alias swIV343 "say emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard "
alias swIV344 "say at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move."
alias swIV345 "say LEIA"
alias swIV346 "say Lord Vader, I should have known. "
alias swIV347 "say Only you could be so bold. The "
alias swIV348 "say Imperial Senate will not sit for "
alias swIV349 "say this, when they hear you've attacked "
alias swIV350 "say a diplomatic..."
alias swIV351 "say VADER"
alias swIV352 "say Don't play games with me, Your "
alias swIV353 "say Highness. You weren't on any mercy "
alias swIV354 "say mission this time. You passed directly "
alias swIV355 "say through a restricted system. Several "
alias swIV356 "say transmissions were beamed to this "
alias swIV357 "say ship by Rebel spies. I want to know "
alias swIV358 "say what happened to the plans they sent "
alias swIV359 "say you."
alias swIV360 "say LEIA"
alias swIV361 "say I don't know what you're talking "
alias swIV362 "say about. I'm a member of the Imperial "
alias swIV363 "say Senate on a diplomatic mission to "
alias swIV364 "say Alderaan..."
alias swIV365 "say VADER"
alias swIV366 "say You're a part of the Rebel Alliance... "
alias swIV367 "say and a traitor. Take her away!"
alias swIV368 "say Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering "
alias swIV369 "say hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander "
alias swIV370 "say turns to Vader."
alias swIV371 "say COMMANDER"
alias swIV372 "say Holding her is dangerous. If word of "
alias swIV373 "say this gets out, it could generate "
alias swIV374 "say sympathy for the Rebellion in the "
alias swIV375 "say senate."
alias swIV376 "say VADER"
alias swIV377 "say I have traced the Rebel spies to "
alias swIV378 "say her. Now she is my only link to find "
alias swIV379 "say their secret base!"
alias swIV380 "say COMMANDER"
alias swIV381 "say She'll die before she tells you "
alias swIV382 "say anything."
alias swIV383 "say VADER"
alias swIV384 "say Leave that to me. Send a distress "
alias swIV385 "say signal and then inform the senate "
alias swIV386 "say that all aboard were killed!"
alias swIV387 "say Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander. "
alias swIV388 "say They stop and snap to attention."
alias swIV389 "say SECOND OFFICER"
alias swIV390 "say Lord Vader, the battle station plans "
alias swIV391 "say are not aboard this ship! And no "
alias swIV392 "say transmissions were made. An escape "
alias swIV393 "say pod was jettisoned during the "
alias swIV394 "say fighting, but no life forms were "
alias swIV395 "say aboard."
alias swIV396 "say Vader turns to the Commander."
alias swIV397 "say VADER"
alias swIV398 "say She must have hidden the plans in "
alias swIV399 "say the escape pod. Send a detachment "
alias swIV400 "say down to retrieve them. See to it "
alias swIV401 "say personally, Commander. There'll be "
alias swIV402 "say no one to stop us this time."
alias swIV403 "say COMMANDER"
alias swIV404 "say Yes, sir."
alias swIV405 "say EXT. SPACE"
alias swIV406 "say The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the "
alias swIV407 "say planet Tatooine."
alias swIV408 "say EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT"
alias swIV409 "say Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas "
alias swIV410 "say meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids "
alias swIV411 "say kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily "
alias swIV412 "say work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in "
alias swIV413 "say the distance rests half buried in the sand."
alias swIV414 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV415 "say How did I get into this mess? I really "
alias swIV416 "say don't know how. We seem to be made "
alias swIV417 "say to suffer. It's our lot in life."
alias swIV418 "say Artoo answers with beeping sounds."
alias swIV419 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV420 "say I've got to rest before I fall apart. "
alias swIV421 "say My joints are almost frozen."
alias swIV422 "say Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds."
alias swIV423 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV424 "say What a desolate place this is."
alias swIV425 "say Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts "
alias swIV426 "say off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio "
alias swIV427 "say stops and yells at him."
alias swIV428 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV429 "say Where are you going?"
alias swIV430 "say A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small "
alias swIV431 "say robot."
alias swIV432 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV433 "say Well, I'm not going that way. It's "
alias swIV434 "say much too rocky. This way is much "
alias swIV435 "say easier."
alias swIV436 "say Artoo counters with a long whistle."
alias swIV437 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV438 "say What makes you think there are "
alias swIV439 "say settlements over there?"
alias swIV440 "say Artoo continues to make beeping sounds."
alias swIV441 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV442 "say Don't get technical with me."
alias swIV443 "say Artoo continues to make beeping sounds."
alias swIV444 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV445 "say What mission? What are you talking "
alias swIV446 "say about? I've had just about enough of "
alias swIV447 "say you! Go that way! You'll be "
alias swIV448 "say malfunctioning within a day, you "
alias swIV449 "say nearsighted scrap pile!"
alias swIV450 "say Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the "
alias swIV451 "say direction of the vast dune sea."
alias swIV452 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV453 "say And don't let me catch you following "
alias swIV454 "say me begging for help, because you "
alias swIV455 "say won't get it."
alias swIV456 "say Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges "
alias swIV457 "say off in the direction of the towering mesas."
alias swIV458 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV459 "say No more adventures. I'm not going "
alias swIV460 "say that way."
alias swIV461 "say Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant "
alias swIV462 "say mountains."
alias swIV463 "say EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA"
alias swIV464 "say Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a "
alias swIV465 "say dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless "
alias swIV466 "say miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant "
alias swIV467 "say rock mesas."
alias swIV468 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV469 "say That malfunctioning little twerp. "
alias swIV470 "say This is all his fault! He tricked me "
alias swIV471 "say into going this way, but he'll do no "
alias swIV472 "say better."
alias swIV473 "say In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand "
alias swIV474 "say from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of "
alias swIV475 "say reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving "
alias swIV476 "say towards him."
alias swIV477 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV478 "say Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm "
alias swIV479 "say saved!"
alias swIV480 "say The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the "
alias swIV481 "say approaching transport."
alias swIV482 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV483 "say Over here! Help! Please, help!"
alias swIV484 "say EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY"
alias swIV485 "say Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer "
alias swIV486 "say and the others can be heard working inside."
alias swIV487 "say LUKE"
alias swIV488 "say (Very animated)"
alias swIV489 "say ...so I cut off my power, shut down "
alias swIV490 "say the afterburners and came in low on "
alias swIV491 "say Deak's trail. I was so close I thought "
alias swIV492 "say I was going to fry my instruments. "
alias swIV493 "say As it was I busted up the Skyhopper "
alias swIV494 "say pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty "
alias swIV495 "say upset. He grounded me for the rest "
alias swIV496 "say of the season. You should have been "
alias swIV497 "say there... it was fantastic."
alias swIV498 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV499 "say You ought to take it easy Luke. You "
alias swIV500 "say may be the hottest bushpilot this "
alias swIV501 "say side of Mos Eisley, but those little "
alias swIV502 "say Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it "
alias swIV503 "say up, and one day, whammo, you're going "
alias swIV504 "say to be nothing more than a dark spot "
alias swIV505 "say on the down side of a canyon wall."
alias swIV506 "say LUKE"
alias swIV507 "say Look who's talking. Now that you've "
alias swIV508 "say been around those giant starships "
alias swIV509 "say you're beginning to sound like my "
alias swIV510 "say uncle. You've gotten soft in the "
alias swIV511 "say city..."
alias swIV512 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV513 "say I've missed you kid."
alias swIV514 "say LUKE"
alias swIV515 "say Well, things haven't been the same "
alias swIV516 "say since you left, Biggs. It's been "
alias swIV517 "say so... quiet."
alias swIV518 "say Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke."
alias swIV519 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV520 "say Luke, I didn't come back just to say "
alias swIV521 "say good-bye... I shouldn't tell you "
alias swIV522 "say this, but you're the only one I can "
alias swIV523 "say trust... and if I don't come back, I "
alias swIV524 "say want somebody to know."
alias swIV525 "say Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty."
alias swIV526 "say LUKE"
alias swIV527 "say What are you talking about?"
alias swIV528 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV529 "say I made some friends at the Academy."
alias swIV530 "say (he whispers)"
alias swIV531 "say ...when our frigate goes to one of "
alias swIV532 "say the central systems, we're going to "
alias swIV533 "say jump ship and join the Alliance..."
alias swIV534 "say Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless."
alias swIV535 "say LUKE"
alias swIV536 "say Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! "
alias swIV537 "say How?"
alias swIV538 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV539 "say Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth "
alias swIV540 "say bigger than a meteor crater!"
alias swIV541 "say LUKE"
alias swIV542 "say I'm sorry. I'm quiet."
alias swIV543 "say (he whispers)"
alias swIV544 "say Listen how quiet I am. You can barely "
alias swIV545 "say hear me..."
alias swIV546 "say Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues."
alias swIV547 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV548 "say My friend has a friend on Bestine "
alias swIV549 "say who might help us make contact."
alias swIV550 "say LUKE"
alias swIV551 "say You're crazy! You could wander around "
alias swIV552 "say forever trying to find them."
alias swIV553 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV554 "say I know it's a long shot, but if I "
alias swIV555 "say don't find them I'll do what I can "
alias swIV556 "say on my own... It's what we always "
alias swIV557 "say talked about. Luke, I'm not going to "
alias swIV558 "say wait for the Empire to draft me into "
alias swIV559 "say service. The Rebellion is spreading "
alias swIV560 "say and I want to be on the right side -- "
alias swIV561 "say the side I believe in."
alias swIV562 "say LUKE"
alias swIV563 "say And I'm stuck here..."
alias swIV564 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV565 "say I thought you were going to the "
alias swIV566 "say Academy next term. You'll get your "
alias swIV567 "say chance to get off this rock."
alias swIV568 "say LUKE"
alias swIV569 "say Not likely! I had to cancel my "
alias swIV570 "say application. There has been a lot of "
alias swIV571 "say unrest among the Sandpeople since "
alias swIV572 "say you left... they've even raided the "
alias swIV573 "say outskirts of Anchorhead."
alias swIV574 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV575 "say Your uncle could hold off a whole "
alias swIV576 "say colony of Sandpeople with one blaster."
alias swIV577 "say LUKE"
alias swIV578 "say I know, but he's got enough vaporators "
alias swIV579 "say going to make the place pay off. He "
alias swIV580 "say needs me for just one more season. I "
alias swIV581 "say can't leave him now."
alias swIV582 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV583 "say I feel for you, Luke, you're going "
alias swIV584 "say to have to learn what seems to be "
alias swIV585 "say important or what really is important. "
alias swIV586 "say What good is all your uncle's work "
alias swIV587 "say if it's taken over by the Empire?... "
alias swIV588 "say You know they're starting to "
alias swIV589 "say nationalize commerce in the central "
alias swIV590 "say systems... it won't be long before "
alias swIV591 "say your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving "
alias swIV592 "say for the greater glory of the Empire."
alias swIV593 "say LUKE"
alias swIV594 "say It couldn't happen here. You said it "
alias swIV595 "say yourself. The Empire won't bother "
alias swIV596 "say with this rock."
alias swIV597 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV598 "say Things always change."
alias swIV599 "say LUKE"
alias swIV600 "say I wish I was going... Are you going "
alias swIV601 "say to be around long?"
alias swIV602 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV603 "say No, I'm leaving in the morning..."
alias swIV604 "say LUKE"
alias swIV605 "say Then I guess I won't see you."
alias swIV606 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV607 "say Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout."
alias swIV608 "say LUKE"
alias swIV609 "say Well, I'll be at the Academy next "
alias swIV610 "say season... after that who knows. I "
alias swIV611 "say won't be drafted into the Imperial "
alias swIV612 "say Starfleet that's for sure... Take "
alias swIV613 "say care of yourself, you'll always be "
alias swIV614 "say the best friend I've got."
alias swIV615 "say BIGGS"
alias swIV616 "say So long, Luke."
alias swIV617 "say Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the "
alias swIV618 "say power station."
alias swIV619 "say EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET"
alias swIV620 "say The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange "
alias swIV621 "say foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures "
alias swIV622 "say fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock "
alias swIV623 "say canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he "
alias swIV624 "say goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for "
alias swIV625 "say a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way."
alias swIV626 "say In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall "
alias swIV627 "say and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little "
alias swIV628 "say further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a "
alias swIV629 "say pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the "
alias swIV630 "say narrow path."
alias swIV631 "say The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until "
alias swIV632 "say suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out "
alias swIV633 "say of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages "
alias swIV634 "say one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his "
alias swIV635 "say back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then "
alias swIV636 "say off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller "
alias swIV637 "say than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they "
alias swIV638 "say cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and "
alias swIV639 "say their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be "
alias swIV640 "say seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave "
alias swIV641 "say the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down "
alias swIV642 "say the trail."
alias swIV643 "say EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET"
alias swIV644 "say The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-"
alias swIV645 "say like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a "
alias swIV646 "say small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a "
alias swIV647 "say large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot "
alias swIV648 "say is sucked into the giant machine."
alias swIV649 "say The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders "
alias swIV650 "say and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport."
alias swIV651 "say INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA"
alias swIV652 "say It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo "
alias swIV653 "say switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles "
alias swIV654 "say around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty "
alias swIV655 "say metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and "
alias swIV656 "say maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper "
alias swIV657 "say and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end "
alias swIV658 "say of the chamber."
alias swIV659 "say INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA"
alias swIV660 "say Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the "
alias swIV661 "say middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various "
alias swIV662 "say shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation, "
alias swIV663 "say while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls "
alias swIV664 "say out from the gloom."
alias swIV665 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV666 "say Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!"
alias swIV667 "say A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him."
alias swIV668 "say EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET"
alias swIV669 "say The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent "
alias swIV670 "say twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain "
alias swIV671 "say ridge."
alias swIV672 "say EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY"
alias swIV673 "say Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-"
alias swIV674 "say buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. "
alias swIV675 "say A trooper yells to an officer some distance away."
alias swIV676 "say FIRST TROOPER"
alias swIV677 "say Someone was in the pod. The tracks "
alias swIV678 "say go off in this direction."
alias swIV679 "say A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand "
alias swIV680 "say and gives it to the first trooper."
alias swIV681 "say SECOND TROOPER"
alias swIV682 "say Look, sir -- droids."
alias swIV683 "say EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES"
alias swIV684 "say The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune."
alias swIV685 "say INT. SANDCRAWLER"
alias swIV686 "say Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped "
alias swIV687 "say prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off."
alias swIV688 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV689 "say Wake up! Wake up!"
alias swIV690 "say Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops, "
alias swIV691 "say creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.  "
alias swIV692 "say Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights "
alias swIV693 "say pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long "
alias swIV694 "say chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding "
alias swIV695 "say white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the "
alias swIV696 "say odd assortment of robots."
alias swIV697 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV698 "say We're doomed."
alias swIV699 "say A Jawa starts moving toward them."
alias swIV700 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV701 "say Do you think they'll melt us down?"
alias swIV702 "say Artoo responds, making beeping sounds."
alias swIV703 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV704 "say Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this "
alias swIV705 "say never end?"
alias swIV706 "say EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON"
alias swIV707 "say The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their "
alias swIV708 "say battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of "
alias swIV709 "say the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small "
alias swIV710 "say homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground "
alias swIV711 "say surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small "
alias swIV712 "say adobe block house."
alias swIV713 "say The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening "
alias swIV714 "say them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. "
alias swIV715 "say The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting "
alias swIV716 "say small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils "
alias swIV717 "say should be."
alias swIV718 "say Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, "
alias swIV719 "say a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are "
alias swIV720 "say sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully "
alias swIV721 "say inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- "
alias swIV722 "say shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little "
alias swIV723 "say Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales "
alias swIV724 "say pitch in a queer, unintelligible language."
alias swIV725 "say A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the "
alias swIV726 "say homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru "
alias swIV727 "say standing in the main courtyard."
alias swIV728 "say BERU"
alias swIV729 "say Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a "
alias swIV730 "say translator to be sure it speaks Bocce."
alias swIV731 "say LUKE"
alias swIV732 "say It looks like we don't have much of "
alias swIV733 "say a choice but I'll remind him."
alias swIV734 "say Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment "
alias swIV735 "say for sale with the Jawa leader."
alias swIV736 "say OWEN"
alias swIV737 "say I have no need for a protocol droid."
alias swIV738 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV739 "say (quickly)"
alias swIV740 "say Sir -- not in an environment such as "
alias swIV741 "say this -- that's why I've also been "
alias swIV742 "say programmed for over thirty secondary "
alias swIV743 "say functions that..."
alias swIV744 "say OWEN"
alias swIV745 "say What I really need is a droid that "
alias swIV746 "say understands the binary language of "
alias swIV747 "say moisture vaporators."
alias swIV748 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV749 "say Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was "
alias swIV750 "say programming binary load lifter... "
alias swIV751 "say very similar to your vaporators. You "
alias swIV752 "say could say..."
alias swIV753 "say OWEN"
alias swIV754 "say Do you speak Bocce?"
alias swIV755 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV756 "say Of course I can, sir. It's like a "
alias swIV757 "say second language for me... I'm as "
alias swIV758 "say fluent in Bocce..."
alias swIV759 "say OWEN"
alias swIV760 "say All right shut up!"
alias swIV761 "say (turning to Jawa)"
alias swIV762 "say I'll take this one."
alias swIV763 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV764 "say Shutting up, sir."
alias swIV765 "say OWEN"
alias swIV766 "say Luke, take these two over to the "
alias swIV767 "say garage, will you? I want you to have "
alias swIV768 "say both of them cleaned up before dinner."
alias swIV769 "say LUKE"
alias swIV770 "say But I was going into Toshi Station "
alias swIV771 "say to pick up some power converters..."
alias swIV772 "say OWEN"
alias swIV773 "say You can waste time with your friends "
alias swIV774 "say when your chores are done. Now come "
alias swIV775 "say on, get to it!"
alias swIV776 "say LUKE"
alias swIV777 "say All right, come on! And the red one, "
alias swIV778 "say come on. Well, come on, Red, let's "
alias swIV779 "say go."
alias swIV780 "say As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back "
alias swIV781 "say into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep "
alias swIV782 "say and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained "
alias swIV783 "say by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box."
alias swIV784 "say Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two "
alias swIV785 "say robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the "
alias swIV786 "say head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly."
alias swIV787 "say LUKE"
alias swIV788 "say Uncle Owen..."
alias swIV789 "say OWEN"
alias swIV790 "say Yeah?"
alias swIV791 "say LUKE"
alias swIV792 "say This R2 unit has a bad motivator. "
alias swIV793 "say Look!"
alias swIV794 "say OWEN"
alias swIV795 "say (to the head Jawa)"
alias swIV796 "say Hey, what're you trying to push on "
alias swIV797 "say us?"
alias swIV798 "say The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked "
alias swIV799 "say out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract "
alias swIV800 "say attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps "
alias swIV801 "say Luke on the shoulder."
alias swIV802 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV803 "say (pointing to Artoo)"
alias swIV804 "say Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is "
alias swIV805 "say in prime condition. A real bargain."
alias swIV806 "say LUKE"
alias swIV807 "say Uncle Owen..."
alias swIV808 "say OWEN"
alias swIV809 "say Yeah?"
alias swIV810 "say LUKE"
alias swIV811 "say What about that one?"
alias swIV812 "say OWEN"
alias swIV813 "say (to Jawa)"
alias swIV814 "say What about that blue one? We'll take "
alias swIV815 "say that one."
alias swIV816 "say With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged "
alias swIV817 "say astro-droid for Artoo."
alias swIV818 "say LUKE"
alias swIV819 "say Yeah, take it away."
alias swIV820 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV821 "say Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very "
alias swIV822 "say pleased with that one, sir. He really "
alias swIV823 "say is in first-class condition. I've "
alias swIV824 "say worked with him before. Here he comes."
alias swIV825 "say Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots "
alias swIV826 "say trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry."
alias swIV827 "say LUKE"
alias swIV828 "say Okay, let's go."
alias swIV829 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV830 "say (to Artoo)"
alias swIV831 "say Now, don't you forget this! Why I "
alias swIV832 "say should stick my neck out for you is "
alias swIV833 "say quite beyond my capacity!"
alias swIV834 "say INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON"
alias swIV835 "say The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful "
alias swIV836 "say atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers "
alias swIV837 "say himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the "
alias swIV838 "say battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery "
alias swIV839 "say with a cord to his face."
alias swIV840 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV841 "say Thank the maker! This oil bath is "
alias swIV842 "say going to feel so good. I've got such "
alias swIV843 "say a bad case of dust contamination, I "
alias swIV844 "say can barely move!"
alias swIV845 "say Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought "
alias swIV846 "say as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man "
alias swIV847 "say Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. "
alias swIV848 "say Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he "
alias swIV849 "say slams a wrench across the workbench."
alias swIV850 "say LUKE"
alias swIV851 "say It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is "
alias swIV852 "say right. I'm never gonna get out of "
alias swIV853 "say here!"
alias swIV854 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV855 "say Is there anything I might do to help?"
alias swIV856 "say Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains "
alias swIV857 "say and a tiny smile creeps across his face."
alias swIV858 "say LUKE"
alias swIV859 "say Well, not unless you can alter time, "
alias swIV860 "say speed up the harvest, or teleport me "
alias swIV861 "say off this rock!"
alias swIV862 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV863 "say I don't think so, sir. I'm only a "
alias swIV864 "say droid and not very knowledgeable "
alias swIV865 "say about such things. Not on this planet, "
alias swIV866 "say anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm "
alias swIV867 "say not even sure which planet I'm on."
alias swIV868 "say LUKE"
alias swIV869 "say Well, if there's a bright center to "
alias swIV870 "say the universe, you're on the planet "
alias swIV871 "say that it's farthest from."
alias swIV872 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV873 "say I see, sir."
alias swIV874 "say LUKE"
alias swIV875 "say Uh, you can call me Luke."
alias swIV876 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV877 "say I see, sir Luke."
alias swIV878 "say LUKE"
alias swIV879 "say (laughing)"
alias swIV880 "say Just Luke."
alias swIV881 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV882 "say And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg "
alias swIV883 "say relations, and this is my counterpart, "
alias swIV884 "say Artoo-Detoo."
alias swIV885 "say LUKE"
alias swIV886 "say Hello."
alias swIV887 "say Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to "
alias swIV888 "say scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome "
alias swIV889 "say pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping "
alias swIV890 "say oil from his bronze body."
alias swIV891 "say LUKE"
alias swIV892 "say You got a lot of carbon scoring here. "
alias swIV893 "say It looks like you boys have seen a "
alias swIV894 "say lot of action."
alias swIV895 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV896 "say With all we've been through, sometimes "
alias swIV897 "say I'm amazed we're in as good condition "
alias swIV898 "say as we are, what with the Rebellion "
alias swIV899 "say and all."
alias swIV900 "say LUKE"
alias swIV901 "say You know of the Rebellion against "
alias swIV902 "say the Empire?"
alias swIV903 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV904 "say That's how we came to be in your "
alias swIV905 "say service, if you take my meaning, "
alias swIV906 "say sir."
alias swIV907 "say LUKE"
alias swIV908 "say Have you been in many battles?"
alias swIV909 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV910 "say Several, I think. Actually, there's "
alias swIV911 "say not much to tell. I'm not much more "
alias swIV912 "say than an interpreter, and not very "
alias swIV913 "say good at telling stories. Well, not "
alias swIV914 "say at making them interesting, anyways."
alias swIV915 "say Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's "
alias swIV916 "say neck joint. He uses a larger pick."
alias swIV917 "say LUKE"
alias swIV918 "say Well, my little friend, you've got "
alias swIV919 "say something jammed in here real good. "
alias swIV920 "say Were you on a cruiser or..."
alias swIV921 "say The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling "
alias swIV922 "say head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-"
alias swIV923 "say dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being "
alias swIV924 "say projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a "
alias swIV925 "say rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly "
alias swIV926 "say lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe."
alias swIV927 "say LEIA"
alias swIV928 "say Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my "
alias swIV929 "say only hope."
alias swIV930 "say LUKE"
alias swIV931 "say What's this?"
alias swIV932 "say Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio "
alias swIV933 "say to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment "
alias swIV934 "say over and over."
alias swIV935 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV936 "say What is what?!? He asked you a "
alias swIV937 "say question..."
alias swIV938 "say (pointing to Leia)"
alias swIV939 "say What is that?"
alias swIV940 "say Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice "
alias swIV941 "say the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer "
alias swIV942 "say for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the "
alias swIV943 "say sentence fragment over and over."
alias swIV944 "say LEIA"
alias swIV945 "say Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my "
alias swIV946 "say only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. "
alias swIV947 "say You're my only hope."
alias swIV948 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV949 "say Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely "
alias swIV950 "say a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no "
alias swIV951 "say mind."
alias swIV952 "say Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl."
alias swIV953 "say LUKE"
alias swIV954 "say Who is she? She's beautiful."
alias swIV955 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV956 "say I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir."
alias swIV957 "say LEIA"
alias swIV958 "say Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi..."
alias swIV959 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV960 "say I think she was a passenger on our "
alias swIV961 "say last voyage. A person of some "
alias swIV962 "say importance, sir -- I believe. Our "
alias swIV963 "say captain was attached to..."
alias swIV964 "say LUKE"
alias swIV965 "say Is there more to this recording?"
alias swIV966 "say Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic "
alias swIV967 "say squeaks and a whistle."
alias swIV968 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV969 "say Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going "
alias swIV970 "say to get us in trouble. It's all right, "
alias swIV971 "say you can trust him. He's our new "
alias swIV972 "say master."
alias swIV973 "say Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio."
alias swIV974 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV975 "say He says he's the property of Obi-Wan "
alias swIV976 "say Kenobi, a resident of these parts. "
alias swIV977 "say And it's a private message for him. "
alias swIV978 "say Quite frankly, sir I don't know what "
alias swIV979 "say he's talking about. Our last master "
alias swIV980 "say was Captain Antilles, but with what "
alias swIV981 "say we've been through, this little R2 "
alias swIV982 "say unit has become a bit eccentric."
alias swIV983 "say LUKE"
alias swIV984 "say Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means "
alias swIV985 "say old Ben Kenobi?"
alias swIV986 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV987 "say I beg your pardon, sir, but do you "
alias swIV988 "say know what he's talking about?"
alias swIV989 "say LUKE"
alias swIV990 "say Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-"
alias swIV991 "say Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond "
alias swIV992 "say the dune sea. He's kind of a strange "
alias swIV993 "say old hermit."
alias swIV994 "say Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few "
alias swIV995 "say moments."
alias swIV996 "say LUKE"
alias swIV997 "say I wonder who she is. It sounds like "
alias swIV998 "say she's in trouble. I'd better play "
alias swIV999 "say back the whole thing."
alias swIV1000 "say Artoo beeps something to Threepio."
alias swIV1001 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1002 "say He says the restraining bolt has "
alias swIV1003 "say short circuited his recording system. "
alias swIV1004 "say He suggests that if you remove the "
alias swIV1005 "say bolt, he might be able to play back "
alias swIV1006 "say the entire recording."
alias swIV1007 "say Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't "
alias swIV1008 "say really heard what Threepio has been saying."
alias swIV1009 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1010 "say H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're "
alias swIV1011 "say too small to run away on me if I "
alias swIV1012 "say take this off! Okay."
alias swIV1013 "say Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off "
alias swIV1014 "say Artoo's side."
alias swIV1015 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1016 "say There you go."
alias swIV1017 "say The princess immediately disappears..."
alias swIV1018 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1019 "say Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? "
alias swIV1020 "say Bring her back! Play back the entire "
alias swIV1021 "say message."
alias swIV1022 "say Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in "
alias swIV1023 "say embarrassment."
alias swIV1024 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1025 "say What message? The one you're carrying "
alias swIV1026 "say inside your rusty innards!"
alias swIV1027 "say A women's voice calls out from another room."
alias swIV1028 "say AUNT BERU"
alias swIV1029 "say Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!"
alias swIV1030 "say Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning "
alias swIV1031 "say robot."
alias swIV1032 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1033 "say All right, I'll be right there, Aunt "
alias swIV1034 "say Beru."
alias swIV1035 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1036 "say I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to "
alias swIV1037 "say have picked up a slight flutter."
alias swIV1038 "say Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and "
alias swIV1039 "say hurries out of the room."
alias swIV1040 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1041 "say Well, see what you can do with him. "
alias swIV1042 "say I'll be right back."
alias swIV1043 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1044 "say (to Artoo)"
alias swIV1045 "say Just you reconsider playing that "
alias swIV1046 "say message for him."
alias swIV1047 "say Artoo beeps in response."
alias swIV1048 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1049 "say No, I don't think he likes you at "
alias swIV1050 "say all."
alias swIV1051 "say Artoo beeps."
alias swIV1052 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1053 "say No, I don't like you either."
alias swIV1054 "say INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA"
alias swIV1055 "say Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher "
alias swIV1056 "say with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-"
alias swIV1057 "say used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls "
alias swIV1058 "say of food and starts for the dining area."
alias swIV1059 "say Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with "
alias swIV1060 "say steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red "
alias swIV1061 "say grain."
alias swIV1062 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1063 "say You know, I think that R2 unit we "
alias swIV1064 "say bought might have been stolen."
alias swIV1065 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1066 "say What makes you think that?"
alias swIV1067 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1068 "say Well, I stumbled across a recording "
alias swIV1069 "say while I was cleaning him. He says he "
alias swIV1070 "say belongs to someone called Obi-Wan "
alias swIV1071 "say Kenobi."
alias swIV1072 "say Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but "
alias swIV1073 "say manages to control himself."
alias swIV1074 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1075 "say I thought he might have meant old "
alias swIV1076 "say Ben. Do you know what he's talking "
alias swIV1077 "say about? Well, I wonder if he's related "
alias swIV1078 "say to Ben."
alias swIV1079 "say Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger."
alias swIV1080 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1081 "say That old man's just a crazy old "
alias swIV1082 "say wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take "
alias swIV1083 "say that R2 unit into Anchorhead and "
alias swIV1084 "say have its memory flushed. That'll be "
alias swIV1085 "say the end of it. It belongs to us now."
alias swIV1086 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1087 "say But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking "
alias swIV1088 "say for him?"
alias swIV1089 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1090 "say He won't, I don't think he exists "
alias swIV1091 "say any more. He died about the same "
alias swIV1092 "say time as your father."
alias swIV1093 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1094 "say He knew my father?"
alias swIV1095 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1096 "say I told you to forget it. Your only "
alias swIV1097 "say concern is to prepare the new droids "
alias swIV1098 "say for tomorrow. In the morning I want "
alias swIV1099 "say them on the south ridge working out "
alias swIV1100 "say those condensers."
alias swIV1101 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1102 "say Yes, sir. I think those new droids "
alias swIV1103 "say are going to work out fine. In fact, "
alias swIV1104 "say I, uh, was also thinking about our "
alias swIV1105 "say agreement about my staying on another "
alias swIV1106 "say season. And if these new droids do "
alias swIV1107 "say work out, I want to transmit my "
alias swIV1108 "say application to the Academy this year."
alias swIV1109 "say Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress "
alias swIV1110 "say it."
alias swIV1111 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1112 "say You mean the next semester before "
alias swIV1113 "say harvest?"
alias swIV1114 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1115 "say Sure, there're more than enough "
alias swIV1116 "say droids."
alias swIV1117 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1118 "say Harvest is when I need you the most. "
alias swIV1119 "say Only one more season. This year we'll "
alias swIV1120 "say make enough on the harvest so I'll "
alias swIV1121 "say be able to hire some more hands. And "
alias swIV1122 "say then you can go to the Academy next "
alias swIV1123 "say year."
alias swIV1124 "say Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle."
alias swIV1125 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1126 "say You must understand I need you here, "
alias swIV1127 "say Luke."
alias swIV1128 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1129 "say But it's a whole 'nother year."
alias swIV1130 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1131 "say Look, it's only one more season."
alias swIV1132 "say Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands."
alias swIV1133 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1134 "say Yeah, that's what you said last year "
alias swIV1135 "say when Biggs and Tank left."
alias swIV1136 "say AUNT BERU"
alias swIV1137 "say Where are you going?"
alias swIV1138 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1139 "say It looks like I'm going nowhere. I "
alias swIV1140 "say have to finish cleaning those droids."
alias swIV1141 "say Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen "
alias swIV1142 "say mechanically finishes his dinner."
alias swIV1143 "say AUNT BERU"
alias swIV1144 "say Owen, he can't stay here forever. "
alias swIV1145 "say Most of his friends have gone. It "
alias swIV1146 "say means so much to him."
alias swIV1147 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1148 "say I'll make it up to him next year. I "
alias swIV1149 "say promise."
alias swIV1150 "say AUNT BERU"
alias swIV1151 "say Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He "
alias swIV1152 "say has too much of his father in him."
alias swIV1153 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1154 "say That's what I'm afraid of."
alias swIV1155 "say EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD"
alias swIV1156 "say The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a "
alias swIV1157 "say distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few "
alias swIV1158 "say moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the "
alias swIV1159 "say homestead."
alias swIV1160 "say INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE"
alias swIV1161 "say Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in "
alias swIV1162 "say sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt "
alias swIV1163 "say similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the "
alias swIV1164 "say box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a "
alias swIV1165 "say short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship."
alias swIV1166 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1167 "say What are you doing hiding there?"
alias swIV1168 "say Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in "
alias swIV1169 "say sight."
alias swIV1170 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1171 "say It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't "
alias swIV1172 "say deactivate me. I told him not to go, "
alias swIV1173 "say but he's faulty, malfunctioning; "
alias swIV1174 "say kept babbling on about his mission."
alias swIV1175 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1176 "say Oh, no!"
alias swIV1177 "say Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio."
alias swIV1178 "say EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD"
alias swIV1179 "say Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead "
alias swIV1180 "say and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-"
alias swIV1181 "say robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the "
alias swIV1182 "say salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his "
alias swIV1183 "say electrobinoculars."
alias swIV1184 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1185 "say That R2 unit has always been a "
alias swIV1186 "say problem. These astro-droids are "
alias swIV1187 "say getting quite out of hand. Even I "
alias swIV1188 "say can't understand their logic at times."
alias swIV1189 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1190 "say How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere "
alias swIV1191 "say in sight. Blast it!"
alias swIV1192 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1193 "say Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go "
alias swIV1194 "say after him?"
alias swIV1195 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1196 "say It's too dangerous with all the "
alias swIV1197 "say Sandpeople around. We'll have to "
alias swIV1198 "say wait until morning."
alias swIV1199 "say Owen yells up from the homestead plaza."
alias swIV1200 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1201 "say Luke, I'm shutting the power down "
alias swIV1202 "say for the night."
alias swIV1203 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1204 "say All right, I'll be there in a few "
alias swIV1205 "say minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it."
alias swIV1206 "say He takes one final look across the dim horizon."
alias swIV1207 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1208 "say You know that little droid is going "
alias swIV1209 "say to cause me a lot of trouble."
alias swIV1210 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1211 "say Oh, he excels at that, sir."
alias swIV1212 "say INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA"
alias swIV1213 "say Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of "
alias swIV1214 "say the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of "
alias swIV1215 "say Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead."
alias swIV1216 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1217 "say Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be "
alias swIV1218 "say loafing now!"
alias swIV1219 "say INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN"
alias swIV1220 "say The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru "
alias swIV1221 "say prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff."
alias swIV1222 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1223 "say Have you seen Luke this morning?"
alias swIV1224 "say AUNT BERU"
alias swIV1225 "say He said he had some things to do "
alias swIV1226 "say before he started today, so he left "
alias swIV1227 "say early."
alias swIV1228 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1229 "say Uh? Did he take those two new droids "
alias swIV1230 "say with him?"
alias swIV1231 "say AUNT BERU"
alias swIV1232 "say I think so."
alias swIV1233 "say OWEN"
alias swIV1234 "say Well, he'd better have those units "
alias swIV1235 "say in the south range repaired be midday "
alias swIV1236 "say or there'll be hell to pay!"
alias swIV1237 "say EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY"
alias swIV1238 "say The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio "
alias swIV1239 "say pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast "
alias swIV1240 "say wasteland."
alias swIV1241 "say INT./EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING - "
alias swIV1242 "say DAY"
alias swIV1243 "say Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something "
alias swIV1244 "say in the motor compartment."
alias swIV1245 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1246 "say (yelling)"
alias swIV1247 "say How's that."
alias swIV1248 "say Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the "
alias swIV1249 "say wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut."
alias swIV1250 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1251 "say Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this "
alias swIV1252 "say direction somewhere, but I don't see "
alias swIV1253 "say how that R2 unit could have come "
alias swIV1254 "say this far. We must have missed him. "
alias swIV1255 "say Uncle Owen isn't going to take this "
alias swIV1256 "say very well."
alias swIV1257 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1258 "say Sir, would it help if you told him "
alias swIV1259 "say it was my fault."
alias swIV1260 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1261 "say (brightening)"
alias swIV1262 "say Sure. He needs you. He'd probably "
alias swIV1263 "say only deactivate you for a day or "
alias swIV1264 "say so..."
alias swIV1265 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1266 "say Deactivate! Well, on the other hand "
alias swIV1267 "say if you hadn't removed his restraining "
alias swIV1268 "say bolt..."
alias swIV1269 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1270 "say Wait, there's something dead ahead "
alias swIV1271 "say on the scanner. It looks like our "
alias swIV1272 "say droid... hit the accelerator."
alias swIV1273 "say EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY"
alias swIV1274 "say From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen "
alias swIV1275 "say gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground "
alias swIV1276 "say two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert "
alias swIV1277 "say cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the "
alias swIV1278 "say marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle "
alias swIV1279 "say and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs "
alias swIV1280 "say the gun before it can be fired."
alias swIV1281 "say The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called, "
alias swIV1282 "say speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an "
alias swIV1283 "say animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in "
alias swIV1284 "say the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain."
alias swIV1285 "say EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON"
alias swIV1286 "say The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied "
alias swIV1287 "say to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large "
alias swIV1288 "say as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, "
alias swIV1289 "say and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders "
alias swIV1290 "say mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs "
alias swIV1291 "say and ride off down the rugged bluff."
alias swIV1292 "say EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR"
alias swIV1293 "say The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke, "
alias swIV1294 "say with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands "
alias swIV1295 "say before little Artoo."
alias swIV1296 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1297 "say Hey, whoa, just where do you think "
alias swIV1298 "say you're going?"
alias swIV1299 "say The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses "
alias swIV1300 "say menacingly behind the little runaway."
alias swIV1301 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1302 "say Master Luke here is your rightful "
alias swIV1303 "say owner. We'll have no more of this "
alias swIV1304 "say Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't "
alias swIV1305 "say talk to me about your mission, either. "
alias swIV1306 "say You're fortunate he doesn't blast "
alias swIV1307 "say you into a million pieces right here."
alias swIV1308 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1309 "say Well, come on. It's getting late. I "
alias swIV1310 "say only hope we can get back before "
alias swIV1311 "say Uncle Owen really blows up."
alias swIV1312 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1313 "say If you don't mind my saying so, sir, "
alias swIV1314 "say I think you should deactivate the "
alias swIV1315 "say little fugitive until you've gotten "
alias swIV1316 "say him back to your workshop."
alias swIV1317 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1318 "say No, he's not going to try anything."
alias swIV1319 "say Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic "
alias swIV1320 "say whistles and screams."
alias swIV1321 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1322 "say What's wrong with him now?"
alias swIV1323 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1324 "say Oh my... sir, he says there are "
alias swIV1325 "say several creatures approaching from "
alias swIV1326 "say the southeast."
alias swIV1327 "say Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south."
alias swIV1328 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1329 "say Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's "
alias swIV1330 "say have a look. Come on."
alias swIV1331 "say EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY"
alias swIV1332 "say Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and "
alias swIV1333 "say scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the "
alias swIV1334 "say two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young "
alias swIV1335 "say adventurer."
alias swIV1336 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1337 "say There are two Banthas down there but "
alias swIV1338 "say I don't see any... wait a second, "
alias swIV1339 "say they're Sandpeople all right. I can "
alias swIV1340 "say see one of them now."
alias swIV1341 "say Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his "
alias swIV1342 "say electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of "
alias swIV1343 "say his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, "
alias swIV1344 "say gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled "
alias swIV1345 "say and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be "
alias swIV1346 "say heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles "
alias swIV1347 "say down the side of the mountain."
alias swIV1348 "say The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed "
alias swIV1349 "say gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in "
alias swIV1350 "say the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block "
alias swIV1351 "say the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces. "
alias swIV1352 "say The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced "
alias swIV1353 "say to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands "
alias swIV1354 "say over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible "
alias swIV1355 "say shrieking laugh."
alias swIV1356 "say EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY"
alias swIV1357 "say Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in "
alias swIV1358 "say the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the "
alias swIV1359 "say inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the "
alias swIV1360 "say speeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts "
alias swIV1361 "say and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then "
alias swIV1362 "say everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan "
alias swIV1363 "say is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the "
alias swIV1364 "say Sandpeople fleeing in terror."
alias swIV1365 "say Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight "
alias swIV1366 "say swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even "
alias swIV1367 "say closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and "
alias swIV1368 "say leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and "
alias swIV1369 "say weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating "
alias swIV1370 "say eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes "
alias swIV1371 "say as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a "
alias swIV1372 "say slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him."
alias swIV1373 "say BEN"
alias swIV1374 "say Hello there! Come here my little "
alias swIV1375 "say friend. Don't be afraid."
alias swIV1376 "say Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and "
alias swIV1377 "say begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on "
alias swIV1378 "say Luke's forehead and he begins to come around."
alias swIV1379 "say BEN"
alias swIV1380 "say Don't worry, he'll be all right."
alias swIV1381 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1382 "say What happened?"
alias swIV1383 "say BEN"
alias swIV1384 "say Rest easy, son, you've had a busy "
alias swIV1385 "say day. You're fortunate you're still "
alias swIV1386 "say in one piece."
alias swIV1387 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1388 "say Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to "
alias swIV1389 "say see you!"
alias swIV1390 "say BEN"
alias swIV1391 "say The Jundland wastes are not to be "
alias swIV1392 "say traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, "
alias swIV1393 "say what brings you out this far?"
alias swIV1394 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1395 "say Oh, this little droid! I think he's "
alias swIV1396 "say searching for his former master... "
alias swIV1397 "say I've never seen such devotion in a "
alias swIV1398 "say droid before... there seems to be no "
alias swIV1399 "say stopping him. He claims to be the "
alias swIV1400 "say property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he "
alias swIV1401 "say a relative of yours? Do you know who "
alias swIV1402 "say he's talking about?"
alias swIV1403 "say Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard."
alias swIV1404 "say BEN"
alias swIV1405 "say Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats "
alias swIV1406 "say a name I haven't heard in a long "
alias swIV1407 "say time... a long time."
alias swIV1408 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1409 "say I think my uncle knew him. He said "
alias swIV1410 "say he was dead."
alias swIV1411 "say BEN"
alias swIV1412 "say Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet."
alias swIV1413 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1414 "say You know him!"
alias swIV1415 "say BEN"
alias swIV1416 "say Well of course, of course I know "
alias swIV1417 "say him. He's me! I haven't gone by the "
alias swIV1418 "say name Obi-Wan since oh, before you "
alias swIV1419 "say were born."
alias swIV1420 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1421 "say Then the droid does belong to you."
alias swIV1422 "say BEN"
alias swIV1423 "say Don't seem to remember ever owning a "
alias swIV1424 "say droid. Very interesting..."
alias swIV1425 "say He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs."
alias swIV1426 "say BEN"
alias swIV1427 "say I think we better get indoors. The "
alias swIV1428 "say Sandpeople are easily startled but "
alias swIV1429 "say they will soon be back and in greater "
alias swIV1430 "say numbers."
alias swIV1431 "say Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic "
alias swIV1432 "say beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around."
alias swIV1433 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1434 "say Threepio!"
alias swIV1435 "say EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY"
alias swIV1436 "say Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins "
alias swIV1437 "say to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and "
alias swIV1438 "say Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half "
alias swIV1439 "say buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off."
alias swIV1440 "say Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then "
alias swIV1441 "say flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally "
alias swIV1442 "say the mechanical man's systems turn on."
alias swIV1443 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1444 "say Where am I? I must have taken a bad "
alias swIV1445 "say step..."
alias swIV1446 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1447 "say Can you stand? We've got to get out "
alias swIV1448 "say of here before the Sandpeople return."
alias swIV1449 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1450 "say I don't think I can make it. You go "
alias swIV1451 "say on, Master Luke. There's no sense in "
alias swIV1452 "say you risking yourself on my account. "
alias swIV1453 "say I'm done for."
alias swIV1454 "say Artoo makes a beeping sound."
alias swIV1455 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1456 "say No, you're not. What kind of talk is "
alias swIV1457 "say that?"
alias swIV1458 "say Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little "
alias swIV1459 "say Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around "
alias swIV1460 "say suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the "
alias swIV1461 "say air."
alias swIV1462 "say BEN"
alias swIV1463 "say Quickly, son... they're on the move."
alias swIV1464 "say INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING"
alias swIV1465 "say The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but "
alias swIV1466 "say still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and "
alias swIV1467 "say security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as "
alias swIV1468 "say old Ben sits thinking."
alias swIV1469 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1470 "say No, my father didn't fight in the "
alias swIV1471 "say wars. He was a navigator on a spice "
alias swIV1472 "say freighter."
alias swIV1473 "say BEN"
alias swIV1474 "say That's what your uncle told you. He "
alias swIV1475 "say didn't hold with your father's ideals. "
alias swIV1476 "say Thought he should have stayed here "
alias swIV1477 "say and not gotten involved."
alias swIV1478 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1479 "say You fought in the Clone Wars?"
alias swIV1480 "say BEN"
alias swIV1481 "say Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the "
alias swIV1482 "say same as your father."
alias swIV1483 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1484 "say I wish I'd known him."
alias swIV1485 "say BEN"
alias swIV1486 "say He was the best star-pilot in the "
alias swIV1487 "say galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I "
alias swIV1488 "say understand you've become quite a "
alias swIV1489 "say good pilot yourself. And he was a "
alias swIV1490 "say good friend. Which reminds me..."
alias swIV1491 "say Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.  "
alias swIV1492 "say As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the "
alias swIV1493 "say restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.  "
alias swIV1494 "say Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the "
alias swIV1495 "say table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle "
alias swIV1496 "say with several electronic gadgets attached to it."
alias swIV1497 "say BEN"
alias swIV1498 "say I have something here for you. Your "
alias swIV1499 "say father wanted you to have this when "
alias swIV1500 "say you were old enough, but your uncle "
alias swIV1501 "say wouldn't allow it. He feared you "
alias swIV1502 "say might follow old Obi-Wan on some "
alias swIV1503 "say damned-fool idealistic crusade like "
alias swIV1504 "say your father did."
alias swIV1505 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1506 "say Sir, if you'll not be needing me, "
alias swIV1507 "say I'll close down for awhile."
alias swIV1508 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1509 "say Sure, go ahead."
alias swIV1510 "say Ben hands Luke the saber."
alias swIV1511 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1512 "say What is it?"
alias swIV1513 "say BEN"
alias swIV1514 "say Your fathers lightsaber. This is the "
alias swIV1515 "say weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy "
alias swIV1516 "say or as random as a blaster."
alias swIV1517 "say Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out "
alias swIV1518 "say about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across "
alias swIV1519 "say the ceiling."
alias swIV1520 "say BEN"
alias swIV1521 "say An elegant weapon for a more civilized "
alias swIV1522 "say time. For over a thousand generations "
alias swIV1523 "say the Jedi Knights were the guardians "
alias swIV1524 "say of peace and justice in the Old "
alias swIV1525 "say Republic. Before the dark times, "
alias swIV1526 "say before the Empire."
alias swIV1527 "say Luke hasn't really been listening."
alias swIV1528 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1529 "say How did my father die?"
alias swIV1530 "say BEN"
alias swIV1531 "say A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who "
alias swIV1532 "say was a pupil of mine until he turned "
alias swIV1533 "say to evil, helped the Empire hunt down "
alias swIV1534 "say and destroy the Jedi Knights. He "
alias swIV1535 "say betrayed and murdered your father. "
alias swIV1536 "say Now the Jedi are all but extinct. "
alias swIV1537 "say Vader was seduced by the dark side "
alias swIV1538 "say of the Force."
alias swIV1539 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1540 "say The Force?"
alias swIV1541 "say BEN"
alias swIV1542 "say Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi "
alias swIV1543 "say his power. It's an energy field "
alias swIV1544 "say created by all living things. It "
alias swIV1545 "say surrounds us and penetrates us. It "
alias swIV1546 "say binds the galaxy together."
alias swIV1547 "say Artoo makes beeping sounds."
alias swIV1548 "say BEN"
alias swIV1549 "say Now, let's see if we can't figure "
alias swIV1550 "say out what you are, my little friend. "
alias swIV1551 "say And where you come from."
alias swIV1552 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1553 "say I saw part of the message he was..."
alias swIV1554 "say Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful "
alias swIV1555 "say young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face."
alias swIV1556 "say BEN"
alias swIV1557 "say I seem to have found it."
alias swIV1558 "say Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before "
alias swIV1559 "say his eyes."
alias swIV1560 "say LEIA"
alias swIV1561 "say General Kenobi, years ago you served "
alias swIV1562 "say my father in the Clone Wars. Now he "
alias swIV1563 "say begs you to help him in his struggle "
alias swIV1564 "say against the Empire. I regret that I "
alias swIV1565 "say am unable to present my father's "
alias swIV1566 "say request to you in person, but my "
alias swIV1567 "say ship has fallen under attack and I'm "
alias swIV1568 "say afraid my mission to bring you to "
alias swIV1569 "say Alderaan has failed. I have placed "
alias swIV1570 "say information vital to the survival of "
alias swIV1571 "say the Rebellion into the memory systems "
alias swIV1572 "say of this R2 unit. My father will know "
alias swIV1573 "say how to retrieve it. You must see "
alias swIV1574 "say this droid safely delivered to him "
alias swIV1575 "say on Alderaan. This is our most "
alias swIV1576 "say desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan "
alias swIV1577 "say Kenobi, you're my only hope."
alias swIV1578 "say There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.  "
alias swIV1579 "say Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs "
alias swIV1580 "say on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes."
alias swIV1581 "say BEN"
alias swIV1582 "say You must learn the ways of the Force "
alias swIV1583 "say if you're to come with me to Alderaan."
alias swIV1584 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1585 "say (laughing)"
alias swIV1586 "say Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. "
alias swIV1587 "say I've got to go home. It's late, I'm "
alias swIV1588 "say in for it as it is."
alias swIV1589 "say BEN"
alias swIV1590 "say I need your help, Luke. She needs "
alias swIV1591 "say your help. I'm getting too old for "
alias swIV1592 "say this sort of thing."
alias swIV1593 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1594 "say I can't get involved! I've got work "
alias swIV1595 "say to do! It's not that I like the "
alias swIV1596 "say Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing "
alias swIV1597 "say I can do about it right now. It's "
alias swIV1598 "say such a long way from here."
alias swIV1599 "say BEN"
alias swIV1600 "say That's your uncle talking."
alias swIV1601 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1602 "say (sighing)"
alias swIV1603 "say Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever "
alias swIV1604 "say going to explain this?"
alias swIV1605 "say BEN"
alias swIV1606 "say Learn about the Force, Luke."
alias swIV1607 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1608 "say Look, I can take you as far as "
alias swIV1609 "say Anchorhead. You can get a transport "
alias swIV1610 "say there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're "
alias swIV1611 "say going."
alias swIV1612 "say BEN"
alias swIV1613 "say You must do what you feel is right, "
alias swIV1614 "say of course."
alias swIV1615 "say EXT. SPACE."
alias swIV1616 "say An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like "
alias swIV1617 "say battle station: the Death Star!"
alias swIV1618 "say INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM"
alias swIV1619 "say Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black "
alias swIV1620 "say conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around "
alias swIV1621 "say the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, "
alias swIV1622 "say is speaking."
alias swIV1623 "say TAGGE"
alias swIV1624 "say Until this battle station is fully "
alias swIV1625 "say operational we are vulnerable. The "
alias swIV1626 "say Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. "
alias swIV1627 "say They're more dangerous than you "
alias swIV1628 "say realize."
alias swIV1629 "say The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair."
alias swIV1630 "say MOTTI"
alias swIV1631 "say Dangerous to your starfleet, "
alias swIV1632 "say Commander, not to this battle station!"
alias swIV1633 "say TAGGE"
alias swIV1634 "say The Rebellion will continue to gain "
alias swIV1635 "say a support in the Imperial Senate as "
alias swIV1636 "say long as...."
alias swIV1637 "say Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut "
alias swIV1638 "say short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial "
alias swIV1639 "say outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally, "
alias swIV1640 "say The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and "
alias swIV1641 "say bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his "
alias swIV1642 "say place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind "
alias swIV1643 "say him."
alias swIV1644 "say TARKIN"
alias swIV1645 "say The Imperial Senate will no longer "
alias swIV1646 "say be of any concern to us. I've just "
alias swIV1647 "say received word that the Emperor has "
alias swIV1648 "say dissolved the council permanently. "
alias swIV1649 "say The last remnants of the Old Republic "
alias swIV1650 "say have been swept away."
alias swIV1651 "say TAGGE"
alias swIV1652 "say That's impossible! How will the "
alias swIV1653 "say Emperor maintain control without the "
alias swIV1654 "say bureaucracy?"
alias swIV1655 "say TARKIN"
alias swIV1656 "say The regional governors now have direct "
alias swIV1657 "say control over territories. Fear will "
alias swIV1658 "say keep the local systems in line. Fear "
alias swIV1659 "say of this battle station."
alias swIV1660 "say TAGGE"
alias swIV1661 "say And what of the Rebellion? If the "
alias swIV1662 "say Rebels have obtained a complete "
alias swIV1663 "say technical readout of this station, "
alias swIV1664 "say it is possible, however unlikely, "
alias swIV1665 "say that they might find a weakness and "
alias swIV1666 "say exploit it."
alias swIV1667 "say VADER"
alias swIV1668 "say The plans you refer to will soon be "
alias swIV1669 "say back in our hands."
alias swIV1670 "say MOTTI"
alias swIV1671 "say Any attack made by the Rebels against "
alias swIV1672 "say this station would be a useless "
alias swIV1673 "say gesture, no matter what technical "
alias swIV1674 "say data they've obtained. This station "
alias swIV1675 "say is now the ultimate power in the "
alias swIV1676 "say universe. I suggest we use it!"
alias swIV1677 "say VADER"
alias swIV1678 "say Don't be too proud of this "
alias swIV1679 "say technological terror you've "
alias swIV1680 "say constructed. The ability to destroy "
alias swIV1681 "say a planet is insignificant next to "
alias swIV1682 "say the power of the Force."
alias swIV1683 "say MOTTI"
alias swIV1684 "say Don't try to frighten us with your "
alias swIV1685 "say sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your "
alias swIV1686 "say sad devotion to that ancient religion "
alias swIV1687 "say has not helped you conjure up the "
alias swIV1688 "say stolen data tapes, or given you "
alias swIV1689 "say clairvoyance enough to find the "
alias swIV1690 "say Rebel's hidden fort..."
alias swIV1691 "say Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's "
alias swIV1692 "say spell."
alias swIV1693 "say VADER"
alias swIV1694 "say I find your lack of faith disturbing."
alias swIV1695 "say TARKIN"
alias swIV1696 "say Enough of this! Vader, release him!"
alias swIV1697 "say VADER"
alias swIV1698 "say As you wish."
alias swIV1699 "say TARKIN"
alias swIV1700 "say This bickering is pointless. Lord "
alias swIV1701 "say Vader will provide us with the "
alias swIV1702 "say location of the Rebel fortress by "
alias swIV1703 "say the time this station is operational. "
alias swIV1704 "say We will then crush the Rebellion "
alias swIV1705 "say with one swift stroke."
alias swIV1706 "say EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND"
alias swIV1707 "say The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas "
alias swIV1708 "say Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble "
alias swIV1709 "say and scattered bodies."
alias swIV1710 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1711 "say It looks like Sandpeople did this, "
alias swIV1712 "say all right. Look, here are Gaffi "
alias swIV1713 "say sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... "
alias swIV1714 "say I never heard of them hitting anything "
alias swIV1715 "say this big before."
alias swIV1716 "say Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks."
alias swIV1717 "say BEN"
alias swIV1718 "say They didn't. But we are meant to "
alias swIV1719 "say think they did. These tracks are "
alias swIV1720 "say side by side. Sandpeople always ride "
alias swIV1721 "say single file to hide there numbers."
alias swIV1722 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1723 "say These are the same Jawas that sold "
alias swIV1724 "say us Artoo and Threepio."
alias swIV1725 "say BEN"
alias swIV1726 "say And these blast points, too accurate "
alias swIV1727 "say for Sandpeople. Only Imperial "
alias swIV1728 "say stormtroopers are so precise."

alias swIV1768 "say The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it "
alias swIV1769 "say approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical "
alias swIV1770 "say arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut "

alias swIV1873 "say alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At "
alias swIV1874 "say first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, "
alias swIV1875 "say furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over "
alias swIV1876 "say drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group "
alias swIV1877 "say of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender "

alias swIV1879 "say BARTENDER"
alias swIV1880 "say We don't serve their kind here!"
alias swIV1881 "say Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many "

alias swIV1886 "say BARTENDER"
alias swIV1887 "say Your droids. They'll have to wait "

alias swIV1889 "say Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the "
alias swIV1890 "say Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures "
alias swIV1891 "say along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare."
alias swIV1892 "say Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder."
alias swIV1893 "say LUKE"
alias swIV1894 "say Listen, why don't you wait out by "

alias swIV1897 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV1898 "say I heartily agree with you sir."
alias swIV1899 "say Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the "
alias swIV1900 "say creatures at the bar go back to their drinks."
alias swIV1901 "say Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-"
alias swIV1902 "say looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with "
alias swIV1903 "say fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-"
alias swIV1904 "say covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.  "
alias swIV1905 "say Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers, "
alias swIV1906 "say and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a "
alias swIV1907 "say sight to behold."
alias swIV1908 "say Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times "
alias swIV1909 "say during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets "
alias swIV1910 "say out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit "
alias swIV1911 "say disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between "
alias swIV1912 "say Ben and the giant Wookiee."
alias swIV1913 "say Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips "
alias swIV1914 "say his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear "
alias swIV1915 "say or whatever."
alias swIV1916 "say A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove."
alias swIV1917 "say CREATURE"
alias swIV1918 "say Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?"
alias swIV1919 "say The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore "
alias swIV1920 "say the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby "
alias swIV1921 "say Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the "
alias swIV1922 "say belligerent monstrosity."
alias swIV1923 "say HUMAN"
alias swIV1924 "say He doesn't like you."

alias swIV1929 "say The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some "
alias swIV1930 "say unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young "
alias swIV1931 "say adventurer."
alias swIV1932 "say HUMAN"
alias swIV1933 "say Don't insult us. You just watch "

alias swIV1939 "say You'll be dead."
alias swIV1940 "say The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar "
alias swIV1941 "say moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His "
alias swIV1942 "say three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind "
alias swIV1943 "say Luke."
alias swIV1944 "say BEN"
alias swIV1945 "say This little one isn't worth the "
alias swIV1946 "say effort. Come let me buy you "
alias swIV1947 "say something..."
alias swIV1948 "say A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young "
alias swIV1949 "say would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables "
alias swIV1950 "say and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid. "
alias swIV1951 "say With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked "
alias swIV1952 "say chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben. "
alias swIV1953 "say The bartender panics."
alias swIV1954 "say BARTENDER"
alias swIV1955 "say No blasters! No blaster!"
alias swIV1956 "say With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life "
alias swIV1957 "say and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut "
alias swIV1958 "say in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled, "
alias swIV1959 "say cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns "
alias swIV1960 "say off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. "
alias swIV1961 "say Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, "
alias swIV1962 "say attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter "
alias swIV1963 "say of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is "
alias swIV1964 "say given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing "
alias swIV1965 "say his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben "
alias swIV1966 "say points the the Wookiee."
alias swIV1967 "say BEN"
alias swIV1968 "say This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate "

alias swIV1971 "say Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on "
alias swIV1972 "say an electronic conversation with another little red astro-"

alias swIV1974 "say two stormtroopers in the street."

alias swIV1979 "say instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and "
alias swIV1980 "say follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is "
alias swIV1981 "say sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years "
alias swIV1982 "say old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, "
alias swIV1983 "say and cocksure."
alias swIV1984 "say HAN"
alias swIV1985 "say Han Solo. I'm captain of the "

alias swIV2003 "say the local bulk-cruisers, mind you. "
alias swIV2004 "say I'm talking about the big Corellian "

alias swIV2006 "say you, old man. What's the cargo?"
alias swIV2007 "say BEN"
alias swIV2008 "say Only passengers. Myself, the boy, "
alias swIV2009 "say two droids, and no questions asked."
alias swIV2010 "say HAN"
alias swIV2011 "say What is it? Some kind of local "
alias swIV2012 "say trouble?"

alias swIV2025 "say LUKE"

alias swIV2028 "say here and listen..."
alias swIV2029 "say BEN"
alias swIV2030 "say We haven't that much with us. But we "
alias swIV2031 "say could pay you two thousand now, plus "
alias swIV2032 "say fifteen when we reach Alderaan."
alias swIV2033 "say HAN"
alias swIV2034 "say Seventeen, huh!"
alias swIV2035 "say Han ponders this for a few moments."

alias swIV2049 "say All right, we'll check it out."
alias swIV2050 "say The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben "

alias swIV2052 "say HAN"
alias swIV2053 "say Seventeen thousand! Those guys must "

alias swIV2528 "say Now be careful, Artoo."
alias swIV2529 "say Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his "

alias swIV2533 "say Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and "

alias swIV2543 "say But sir, nobody worries about "
alias swIV2544 "say upsetting a droid."
alias swIV2545 "say HAN"
alias swIV2546 "say That's 'cause droids don't pull "

alias swIV2569 "say the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift "
alias swIV2570 "say lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't "
alias swIV2571 "say move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy, "
alias swIV2572 "say then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood "
alias swIV2573 "say red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing "
alias swIV2574 "say him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter."
alias swIV2575 "say HAN"
alias swIV2576 "say Hokey religions and ancient weapons "
alias swIV2577 "say are no match for a good blaster at "
alias swIV2578 "say your side, kid."

alias swIV2580 "say You don't believe in the Force, do "
alias swIV2581 "say you?"
alias swIV2582 "say HAN"
alias swIV2583 "say Kid, I've flown from one side of "
alias swIV2584 "say this galaxy to the other. I've seen "
alias swIV2585 "say a lot of strange stuff, but I've "
alias swIV2586 "say never seen anything to make me believe "
alias swIV2587 "say there's one all-powerful force "
alias swIV2588 "say controlling everything. There's no "
alias swIV2589 "say mystical energy field that controls "
alias swIV2590 "say my destiny."
alias swIV2591 "say Ben smiles quietly."
alias swIV2592 "say HAN"
alias swIV2593 "say It's all a lot of simple tricks and "
alias swIV2594 "say nonsense."
alias swIV2595 "say BEN"
alias swIV2596 "say I suggest you try it again, Luke."
alias swIV2597 "say Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his "
alias swIV2598 "say eyes."
alias swIV2599 "say BEN"
alias swIV2600 "say This time, let go your conscious "
alias swIV2601 "say self and act on instinct."
alias swIV2602 "say LUKE"
alias swIV2603 "say (laughing)"
alias swIV2604 "say With the blast shield down, I can't "
alias swIV2605 "say even see. How am I supposed to fight?"
alias swIV2606 "say BEN"
alias swIV2607 "say Your eyes can deceive you. Don't "
alias swIV2608 "say trust them."
alias swIV2609 "say Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker "
alias swIV2610 "say into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then "
alias swIV2611 "say drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly "
alias swIV2612 "say missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits "
alias swIV2613 "say Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful "
alias swIV2614 "say yell and attempts to hit the seeker."
alias swIV2615 "say BEN"
alias swIV2616 "say Stretch out with your feelings."
alias swIV2617 "say Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes "
alias swIV2618 "say a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the "
alias swIV2619 "say bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original "
alias swIV2620 "say position."
alias swIV2621 "say BEN"
alias swIV2622 "say You see, you can do it."
alias swIV2623 "say HAN"
alias swIV2624 "say I call it luck."

alias swIV2626 "say In my experience, there's no such "
alias swIV2627 "say thing as luck."
alias swIV2628 "say HAN"
alias swIV2629 "say Look, going good against remotes is "
alias swIV2630 "say one thing. Going good against the "
alias swIV2631 "say living? That's something else."
alias swIV2632 "say Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the "
alias swIV2633 "say control panel."
alias swIV2634 "say HAN"
alias swIV2635 "say Looks like we're coming up on "
alias swIV2636 "say Alderaan."
alias swIV2637 "say Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit."
alias swIV2638 "say LUKE"
alias swIV2639 "say You know, I did feel something. I "
alias swIV2640 "say could almost see the remote."
alias swIV2641 "say BEN"

alias swIV2650 "say Our scout ships have reached "

alias swIV2668 "say Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in "

alias swIV2670 "say Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window "
alias swIV2671 "say stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then "
alias swIV2672 "say stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently "
alias swIV2673 "say shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering "
alias swIV2674 "say the sides of the ship."
alias swIV2675 "say HAN"
alias swIV2676 "say What the...? Aw, we've come out of "
alias swIV2677 "say hyperspace into a meteor shower. "

alias swIV2679 "say It's not on any of the charts."
alias swIV2680 "say The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool "

alias swIV2690 "say HAN"
alias swIV2691 "say Thats what I'm trying to tell you, "

alias swIV2699 "say Destroyed... by the Empire!"
alias swIV2700 "say HAN"
alias swIV2701 "say The entire starfleet couldn't destroy "

alias swIV2712 "say It's an Imperial fighter."
alias swIV2713 "say Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside "

alias swIV2716 "say LUKE"
alias swIV2717 "say It followed us!"
alias swIV2718 "say BEN"

alias swIV2769 "say BEN"
alias swIV2770 "say That's no moon! It's a space station."
alias swIV2771 "say HAN"

alias swIV2773 "say LUKE"
alias swIV2774 "say I have a very bad feeling about this."
alias swIV2775 "say HAN"
alias swIV2776 "say Yeah, I think your right. Full "
alias swIV2777 "say reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary "
alias swIV2778 "say power."
alias swIV2779 "say The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away "
alias swIV2780 "say toward the gargantuan battle station."
alias swIV2781 "say LUKE"
alias swIV2782 "say Why are we still moving towards it?"
alias swIV2783 "say HAN"

alias swIV2799 "say As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome "

alias swIV2852 "say According to the log, the crew "
alias swIV2853 "say abandoned ship right after takeoff. "
alias swIV2854 "say It must be a decoy, sir. Several of "

alias swIV2920 "say A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and "
alias swIV2921 "say waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating "
alias swIV2922 "say his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his "
alias swIV2923 "say head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an "
alias swIV2924 "say annoyed look."
alias swIV2925 "say GANTRY OFFICER"
alias swIV2926 "say Take over. We've got a bad "
alias swIV2927 "say transmitter. I'll see what I can do."
alias swIV2928 "say As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing "
alias swIV2929 "say the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary "
alias swIV2930 "say state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling "
alias swIV2931 "say howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow. "
alias swIV2932 "say The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted "
alias swIV2933 "say by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the "
alias swIV2934 "say robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed "

alias swIV2946 "say Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of "

alias swIV2948 "say carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.  "
alias swIV2949 "say Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly."
alias swIV2950 "say BEN"
alias swIV2951 "say Plug in. He should be able to "
alias swIV2952 "say interpret the entire Imperial computer "
alias swIV2953 "say network."
alias swIV2954 "say Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the "
alias swIV2955 "say vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information "
alias swIV2956 "say to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something."
alias swIV2957 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV2958 "say He says he's found the main computer "
alias swIV2959 "say to power the tractor beam that's "
alias swIV2960 "say holding the ship here. He'll try to "
alias swIV2961 "say make the precise location appear on "
alias swIV2962 "say the monitor."
alias swIV2963 "say The computer monitor flashes readouts."
alias swIV2964 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV2965 "say The tractor beam is coupled to the "

alias swIV2984 "say BEN"
alias swIV2985 "say They must be delivered safely or "
alias swIV2986 "say other star systems will suffer the "
alias swIV2987 "say same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny "
alias swIV2988 "say lies along a different path than "
alias swIV2989 "say mine. The Force will be with you... "
alias swIV2990 "say always!"
alias swIV2991 "say Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps "
alias swIV2992 "say out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey "

alias swIV2995 "say HAN"
alias swIV2996 "say Boy you said it, Chewie."
alias swIV2997 "say Han looks at Luke."

alias swIV3005 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3006 "say I didn't hear you give any ideas..."
alias swIV3007 "say HAN"
alias swIV3008 "say Well, anything would be better than "

alias swIV3010 "say to pick us up..."
alias swIV3011 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3012 "say Who do you think..."
alias swIV3013 "say Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.  "
alias swIV3014 "say Luke goes over to him."
alias swIV3015 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3016 "say What is it?"
alias swIV3017 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV3018 "say I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. "
alias swIV3019 "say He says "I found her", and keeps "
alias swIV3020 "say repeating, "She's here.""
alias swIV3021 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3022 "say Well, who... who has he found?"
alias swIV3023 "say Artoo whistles a frantic reply."
alias swIV3024 "say THREEPIO"

alias swIV3026 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3027 "say The princess? She's here?"

alias swIV3030 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV3031 "say Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-"

alias swIV3033 "say be terminated."
alias swIV3034 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3035 "say Oh, no! We've got to do something."
alias swIV3036 "say HAN"
alias swIV3037 "say What are you talking about?"
alias swIV3038 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3039 "say The droid belongs to her. She's the "
alias swIV3040 "say one in the message... We've got to "
alias swIV3041 "say help her."
alias swIV3042 "say HAN"
alias swIV3043 "say Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. "
alias swIV3044 "say The old man wants us to wait right "
alias swIV3045 "say here."
alias swIV3046 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3047 "say But he didn't know she was here. "
alias swIV3048 "say Look, will you just find a way back "
alias swIV3049 "say into the detention block?"
alias swIV3050 "say HAN"
alias swIV3051 "say I'm not going anywhere."
alias swIV3052 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3053 "say They're going to execute her. Look, "
alias swIV3054 "say a few minutes ago you said you didn't "
alias swIV3055 "say want to just wait here to be captured. "
alias swIV3056 "say Now all you want to do is stay."
alias swIV3057 "say HAN"
alias swIV3058 "say Marching into the detention area is "
alias swIV3059 "say not what I had in mind."
alias swIV3060 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3061 "say But they're going to kill her!"
alias swIV3062 "say HAN"
alias swIV3063 "say Better her than me..."
alias swIV3064 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3065 "say She's rich."

alias swIV3068 "say Rich?"
alias swIV3069 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3070 "say Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you "

alias swIV3072 "say be..."
alias swIV3073 "say HAN"
alias swIV3074 "say What?"
alias swIV3075 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3076 "say Well more wealth that you can imagine."
alias swIV3077 "say HAN"
alias swIV3078 "say I don't know, I can imagine quite a "
alias swIV3079 "say bit!"
alias swIV3080 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3081 "say You'll get it!"
alias swIV3082 "say HAN"
alias swIV3083 "say I better!"
alias swIV3084 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3085 "say You will..."
alias swIV3086 "say HAN"
alias swIV3087 "say All right, kid. But you'd better be "
alias swIV3088 "say right about this."
alias swIV3089 "say Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt."
alias swIV3090 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3091 "say All right."
alias swIV3092 "say HAN"
alias swIV3093 "say What's your plan?"
alias swIV3094 "say LUKE"

alias swIV3105 "say HAN"
alias swIV3106 "say Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know "
alias swIV3107 "say what he has in mind."
alias swIV3108 "say The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as "
alias swIV3109 "say Han binds him with the electronic cuffs."
alias swIV3110 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV3111 "say Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for "
alias swIV3112 "say asking... but, ah... what should "
alias swIV3113 "say Artoo and I do if we're discovered "
alias swIV3114 "say here?"
alias swIV3115 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3116 "say Lock the door!"
alias swIV3117 "say HAN"
alias swIV3118 "say And hope they don't have blasters."
alias swIV3119 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV3120 "say That isn't very reassuring."
alias swIV3121 "say Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and "

alias swIV3124 "say Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits "
alias swIV3125 "say as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops, "
alias swIV3126 "say bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio "
alias swIV3127 "say completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious "
alias swIV3128 "say glance."
alias swIV3129 "say Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters."
alias swIV3130 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3131 "say I can't see a thing in this helmet."
alias swIV3132 "say A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away "
alias swIV3133 "say by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and "
alias swIV3134 "say the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube."
alias swIV3135 "say INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY"
alias swIV3136 "say Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main "
alias swIV3137 "say passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot "
alias swIV3138 "say similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end "
alias swIV3139 "say of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then "
alias swIV3140 "say disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting "
alias swIV3141 "say that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. "
alias swIV3142 "say No one in the hallway seems to notice him."
alias swIV3143 "say INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY "
alias swIV3144 "say AREA"
alias swIV3145 "say Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door "
alias swIV3146 "say slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards "
alias swIV3147 "say enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates "
alias swIV3148 "say are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath."
alias swIV3149 "say HAN"
alias swIV3150 "say This is not going to work."
alias swIV3151 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3152 "say Why didn't you say so before?"
alias swIV3153 "say HAN"
alias swIV3154 "say I did say so before!"
alias swIV3155 "say INT. DETENTION AREA"
alias swIV3156 "say Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches "
alias swIV3157 "say the trio."
alias swIV3158 "say OFFICER"
alias swIV3159 "say Where are you taking this... thing?"
alias swIV3160 "say Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut "
alias swIV3161 "say up."
alias swIV3162 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3163 "say Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-"
alias swIV3164 "say three-eight."
alias swIV3165 "say OFFICER"
alias swIV3166 "say I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear "
alias swIV3167 "say it."
alias swIV3168 "say The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in "
alias swIV3169 "say the information. There are only three other troopers in the "
alias swIV3170 "say area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the "
alias swIV3171 "say alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of "
alias swIV3172 "say Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke."
alias swIV3173 "say Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one "
alias swIV3174 "say of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle."
alias swIV3175 "say HAN"
alias swIV3176 "say Look out! He's loose!"
alias swIV3177 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3178 "say He's going to pull us all apart."
alias swIV3179 "say HAN"
alias swIV3180 "say Go get him!"
alias swIV3181 "say The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and "
alias swIV3182 "say Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are "
alias swIV3183 "say blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of "
alias swIV3184 "say laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser "
alias swIV3185 "say gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the "
alias swIV3186 "say last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is "
alias swIV3187 "say about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink "
alias swIV3188 "say system, which is screeching questions about what is going "
alias swIV3189 "say on.  He quickly checks the computer readout."
alias swIV3190 "say HAN"
alias swIV3191 "say We've got to find out which cell "
alias swIV3192 "say this princess of yours is in. Here "
alias swIV3193 "say it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven. "
alias swIV3194 "say You go get her. I'll hold them here."
alias swIV3195 "say Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into "
alias swIV3196 "say the buzzing comlink."
alias swIV3197 "say HAN"
alias swIV3198 "say (sounding official)"
alias swIV3199 "say Everything is under control. Situation "
alias swIV3200 "say normal."
alias swIV3201 "say INTERCOM VOICE"
alias swIV3202 "say What happened?"
alias swIV3203 "say HAN"
alias swIV3204 "say (getting nervous)"
alias swIV3205 "say Uh... had a slight weapons "
alias swIV3206 "say malfunction. But, uh, everything's "
alias swIV3207 "say perfectly all right now. We're fine. "
alias swIV3208 "say We're all fine here, now, thank you. "
alias swIV3209 "say How are you?"
alias swIV3210 "say INTERCOM VOICE"
alias swIV3211 "say We're sending a squad up."
alias swIV3212 "say HAN"
alias swIV3213 "say Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor "
alias swIV3214 "say leak here now. Give us a few minutes "
alias swIV3215 "say to lock it down. Large leak... very "
alias swIV3216 "say dangerous."
alias swIV3217 "say INTERCOM VOICE"
alias swIV3218 "say Who is this? What's your operating "
alias swIV3219 "say number?"
alias swIV3220 "say Han blasts the comlink and it explodes."
alias swIV3221 "say HAN"
alias swIV3222 "say Boring conversation anyway."
alias swIV3223 "say (yelling down the "
alias swIV3224 "say hall)"
alias swIV3225 "say Luke! We're going to have company!"
alias swIV3226 "say INT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW"
alias swIV3227 "say Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door "
alias swIV3228 "say away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees "
alias swIV3229 "say the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping "
alias swIV3230 "say and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on "
alias swIV3231 "say her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands "
alias swIV3232 "say staring at her with his mouth hanging open."
alias swIV3233 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3234 "say (finally)"
alias swIV3235 "say Aren't you a little short to be a "
alias swIV3236 "say stormtrooper?"
alias swIV3237 "say Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it."
alias swIV3238 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3239 "say What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke "
alias swIV3240 "say Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you."
alias swIV3241 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3242 "say You're who?"
alias swIV3243 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3244 "say I'm here to rescue you. I've got "

alias swIV3246 "say Kenobi."
alias swIV3247 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3248 "say Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?"
alias swIV3249 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3250 "say Come on!"
alias swIV3251 "say INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM"
alias swIV3252 "say Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the "
alias swIV3253 "say far end of the conference table."
alias swIV3254 "say VADER"
alias swIV3255 "say He is here..."
alias swIV3256 "say TARKIN"
alias swIV3257 "say Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think "
alias swIV3258 "say so?"
alias swIV3259 "say VADER"
alias swIV3260 "say A tremor in the Force. The last time "
alias swIV3261 "say I felt it was in the presence of my "
alias swIV3262 "say old master."
alias swIV3263 "say TARKIN"
alias swIV3264 "say Surely he must be dead by now."
alias swIV3265 "say VADER"
alias swIV3266 "say Don't underestimate the power of the "
alias swIV3267 "say Force."
alias swIV3268 "say TARKIN"
alias swIV3269 "say The Jedi are extinct, their fire has "
alias swIV3270 "say gone out of the universe. You, my "
alias swIV3271 "say friend, are all that's left of their "
alias swIV3272 "say religion."
alias swIV3273 "say There is a quiet buzz on the comlink."
alias swIV3274 "say TARKIN"
alias swIV3275 "say Yes."
alias swIV3276 "say INTERCOM VOICE"
alias swIV3277 "say Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency "

alias swIV3284 "say Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with "
alias swIV3285 "say him."
alias swIV3286 "say TARKIN"
alias swIV3287 "say If you're right, he must not be "
alias swIV3288 "say allowed to escape."
alias swIV3289 "say VADER"
alias swIV3290 "say Escape is not his plan. I must face "
alias swIV3291 "say him alone."
alias swIV3292 "say INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - HALLWAY"
alias swIV3293 "say An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the "
alias swIV3294 "say elevator door."
alias swIV3295 "say HAN"
alias swIV3296 "say Chewie!"
alias swIV3297 "say Chewbacca responds with a growling noise."
alias swIV3298 "say HAN"
alias swIV3299 "say Get behind me! Get behind me!"
alias swIV3300 "say A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door "
alias swIV3301 "say through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge."
alias swIV3302 "say Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke "
alias swIV3303 "say and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting "
alias swIV3304 "say up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them."
alias swIV3305 "say HAN"
alias swIV3306 "say Can't get out that way."
alias swIV3307 "say LEIA"

alias swIV3312 "say Maybe you'd like it back in your "
alias swIV3313 "say cell, Your Highness."
alias swIV3314 "say Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they "

alias swIV3329 "say transmitter."
alias swIV3330 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV3331 "say I said, all systems have been alerted "
alias swIV3332 "say to your presence, sir. The main "

alias swIV3337 "say TROOPER VOICE"
alias swIV3338 "say Open up in there!"
alias swIV3339 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV3340 "say Oh, no!"
alias swIV3341 "say INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR"
alias swIV3342 "say Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as "
alias swIV3343 "say they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca "
alias swIV3344 "say are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far "
alias swIV3345 "say and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke "
alias swIV3346 "say fills the narrow cell corridor."
alias swIV3347 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3348 "say There isn't any other way out."
alias swIV3349 "say HAN"

alias swIV3360 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3361 "say Well, I didn't..."
alias swIV3362 "say The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in "

alias swIV3364 "say HAN"
alias swIV3365 "say What the hell are you doing?"
alias swIV3366 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3367 "say Somebody has to save our skins. Into "
alias swIV3368 "say the garbage chute, wise guy."
alias swIV3369 "say She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca "
alias swIV3370 "say look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and "

alias swIV3373 "say Get in there you big furry oaf! I "
alias swIV3374 "say don't care what you smell! Get in "
alias swIV3375 "say there and don't worry about it."
alias swIV3376 "say Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the "

alias swIV3378 "say way toward the opening."
alias swIV3379 "say HAN"
alias swIV3380 "say Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to "
alias swIV3381 "say kill her or I'm beginning to like "
alias swIV3382 "say her. Get in there!"
alias swIV3383 "say Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires "
alias swIV3384 "say off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then "
alias swIV3385 "say slides into the chute himself and is gone."
alias swIV3386 "say INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM"
alias swIV3387 "say Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.  "
alias swIV3388 "say Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He "
alias swIV3389 "say finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't "
alias swIV3390 "say budge."
alias swIV3391 "say HAN"
alias swIV3392 "say (sarcastically)"
alias swIV3393 "say Oh! The garbage chute was a really "
alias swIV3394 "say wonderful idea. What an incredible "
alias swIV3395 "say smell you've discovered! Let's get "
alias swIV3396 "say out of here! Get away from there..."
alias swIV3397 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3398 "say No! wait!"
alias swIV3399 "say Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The "
alias swIV3400 "say laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.  "
alias swIV3401 "say Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes "
alias swIV3402 "say almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a "
alias swIV3403 "say rather grim look on her face."
alias swIV3404 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3405 "say Will you forget it? I already tried "
alias swIV3406 "say it. It's magnetically sealed!"
alias swIV3407 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3408 "say Put that thing away! You're going to "
alias swIV3409 "say get us all killed."
alias swIV3410 "say HAN"
alias swIV3411 "say Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I "
alias swIV3412 "say had everything under control until "
alias swIV3413 "say you led us down here. You know, it's "
alias swIV3414 "say not going to take them long to figure "
alias swIV3415 "say out what happened to us."
alias swIV3416 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3417 "say It could be worse..."
alias swIV3418 "say A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the "
alias swIV3419 "say murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins "
alias swIV3420 "say to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols "
alias swIV3421 "say drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls."
alias swIV3422 "say HAN"
alias swIV3423 "say It's worse."
alias swIV3424 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3425 "say There's something alive in here!"

alias swIV3431 "say HAN"
alias swIV3432 "say What?"
alias swIV3433 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3434 "say Help!"
alias swIV3435 "say Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage."
alias swIV3436 "say HAN"
alias swIV3437 "say Luke! Luke! Luke!"
alias swIV3438 "say Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air "
alias swIV3439 "say and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around "
alias swIV3440 "say his throat."
alias swIV3441 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3442 "say Luke!"
alias swIV3443 "say Leia extends a long pipe toward him."
alias swIV3444 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3445 "say Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this."
alias swIV3446 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3447 "say Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed."
alias swIV3448 "say HAN"
alias swIV3449 "say Where?"
alias swIV3450 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3451 "say Anywhere! Oh!!"
alias swIV3452 "say Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the "
alias swIV3453 "say muck by the slimy tentacle."
alias swIV3454 "say HAN"
alias swIV3455 "say Luke! Luke!"
alias swIV3456 "say Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and "
alias swIV3457 "say move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.  "
alias swIV3458 "say Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca "
alias swIV3459 "say howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke "
alias swIV3460 "say suddenly bobs to the surface."
alias swIV3461 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3462 "say Grab him!"
alias swIV3463 "say Luke seems to be released by the thing."

alias swIV3465 "say What happened?"
alias swIV3466 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3467 "say I don't know, it just let go of me "

alias swIV3469 "say HAN"
alias swIV3470 "say I've got a very bad feeling about "
alias swIV3471 "say this."
alias swIV3472 "say Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and "

alias swIV3474 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3475 "say The walls are moving!"
alias swIV3476 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3477 "say Don't just stand there. Try to brace "
alias swIV3478 "say it with something."
alias swIV3479 "say They place poles and long metal beams between the closing "
alias swIV3480 "say walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant "
alias swIV3481 "say trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good."
alias swIV3482 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3483 "say Wait a minute!"
alias swIV3484 "say Luke pulls out his comlink."
alias swIV3485 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3486 "say Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! "
alias swIV3487 "say Where could he be?"
alias swIV3488 "say INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE"
alias swIV3489 "say A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for "
alias swIV3490 "say See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which "
alias swIV3491 "say is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and "
alias swIV3492 "say Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great "
alias swIV3493 "say explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the "
alias swIV3494 "say floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber."
alias swIV3495 "say FIRST TROOPER"
alias swIV3496 "say Take over!"
alias swIV3497 "say (pointing to the dead "

alias swIV3499 "say See to him! Look there!"
alias swIV3500 "say A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides "
alias swIV3501 "say open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows "
alias swIV3502 "say his bronze companion out into the office."
alias swIV3503 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV3504 "say They're madmen! They're heading for "
alias swIV3505 "say the prison level. If you hurry, you "

alias swIV3507 "say FIRST OFFICER"
alias swIV3508 "say (to his troops)"
alias swIV3509 "say Follow me! You stand guard."

alias swIV3528 "say giant paws."
alias swIV3529 "say Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is "

alias swIV3547 "say Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall "

alias swIV3558 "say HAN"

alias swIV3609 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV3610 "say Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! "

alias swIV3634 "say Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge "

alias swIV3637 "say The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading "

alias swIV3655 "say HAN"
alias swIV3656 "say (to Chewie)"
alias swIV3657 "say Where are you going?"
alias swIV3658 "say The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy "
alias swIV3659 "say tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a "
alias swIV3660 "say victim. Han aims his pistol."
alias swIV3661 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3662 "say No, wait. They'll hear!"
alias swIV3663 "say Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes "
alias swIV3664 "say relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply "
alias swIV3665 "say shakes his head in disgust."
alias swIV3666 "say HAN"
alias swIV3667 "say (to Chewie)"
alias swIV3668 "say Come here, you big coward!"

alias swIV3673 "say Listen. I don't know who you are, or "
alias swIV3674 "say where you came from, but from now "
alias swIV3675 "say on, you do as I tell you. Okay?"
alias swIV3676 "say Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl."
alias swIV3677 "say HAN"
alias swIV3678 "say Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get "
alias swIV3679 "say one thing straight! I take orders "

alias swIV3681 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3682 "say It's a wonder you're still alive."
alias swIV3683 "say (looking at Chewie)"
alias swIV3684 "say Will somebody get this big walking "
alias swIV3685 "say carpet out of my way?"
alias swIV3686 "say Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke."
alias swIV3687 "say HAN"
alias swIV3688 "say No reward is worth this."
alias swIV3689 "say They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor."
alias swIV3690 "say INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH"
alias swIV3691 "say Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of "
alias swIV3692 "say stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly "
alias swIV3693 "say slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few "
alias swIV3694 "say feet of him."
alias swIV3695 "say OFFICER"
alias swIV3696 "say Secure this area until the alert is "
alias swIV3697 "say canceled."
alias swIV3698 "say FIRST TROOPER"
alias swIV3699 "say Give me regular reports."

alias swIV3701 "say FIRST TROOPER"
alias swIV3702 "say Do you know what's going on?"
alias swIV3703 "say SECOND TROOPER"
alias swIV3704 "say Maybe it's another drill."
alias swIV3705 "say Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers "
alias swIV3706 "say as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand "
alias swIV3707 "say toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the "
alias swIV3708 "say other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips "
alias swIV3709 "say past the troopers and into the main hallway."
alias swIV3710 "say SECOND TROOPER"
alias swIV3711 "say What was that?"
alias swIV3712 "say FIRST TROOPER"
alias swIV3713 "say Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about "
alias swIV3714 "say it."
alias swIV3715 "say INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY"
alias swIV3716 "say Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and "
alias swIV3717 "say stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers "
alias swIV3718 "say are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink."
alias swIV3719 "say HAN"
alias swIV3720 "say (looking at his ship)"
alias swIV3721 "say There she is."
alias swIV3722 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3723 "say See-Threepio, do you copy?"
alias swIV3724 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV3725 "say (voice)"
alias swIV3726 "say For the moment. Uh, we're in the "
alias swIV3727 "say main hangar across from the ship."
alias swIV3728 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3729 "say We're right above you. Stand by."
alias swIV3730 "say Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of "
alias swIV3731 "say the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and "
alias swIV3732 "say points out the window to the ship."
alias swIV3733 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3734 "say You came in that thing? You're braver "
alias swIV3735 "say that I thought."
alias swIV3736 "say HAN"
alias swIV3737 "say Nice! Come on!"
alias swIV3738 "say Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the "
alias swIV3739 "say hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty "
alias swIV3740 "say Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are "
alias swIV3741 "say taken by surprise and stop in their tracks."
alias swIV3742 "say FIRST TROOPER"
alias swIV3743 "say It's them! Blast them!"
alias swIV3744 "say Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges "
alias swIV3745 "say the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the "
alias swIV3746 "say stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down "
alias swIV3747 "say the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor."
alias swIV3748 "say HAN"
alias swIV3749 "say (to Luke and Leia)"
alias swIV3750 "say Get back to the ship!"
alias swIV3751 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3752 "say Where are you going? Come back!"
alias swIV3753 "say Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear."
alias swIV3754 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3755 "say He certainly has courage."
alias swIV3756 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3757 "say What good will it do us if he gets "
alias swIV3758 "say himself killed? Come on!"
alias swIV3759 "say Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for "
alias swIV3760 "say muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke "
alias swIV3761 "say and Leia start off toward the starship hangar."
alias swIV3762 "say INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY"
alias swIV3763 "say Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is "
alias swIV3764 "say yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a "
alias swIV3765 "say dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few "
alias swIV3766 "say feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops "
alias swIV3767 "say begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are "
alias swIV3768 "say moving into an attack position in front of the lone "
alias swIV3769 "say starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops "
alias swIV3770 "say begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him."
alias swIV3771 "say INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY"
alias swIV3772 "say Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt "
alias swIV3773 "say to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of "
alias swIV3774 "say laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate "
alias swIV3775 "say extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of "
alias swIV3776 "say furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running "
alias swIV3777 "say the other way also."
alias swIV3778 "say INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY"
alias swIV3779 "say Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down "
alias swIV3780 "say a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They "
alias swIV3781 "say quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an "
alias swIV3782 "say open hatchway."
alias swIV3783 "say INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT"
alias swIV3784 "say Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge "
alias swIV3785 "say that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. "
alias swIV3786 "say The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, "
alias swIV3787 "say and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance "
alias swIV3788 "say off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of "
alias swIV3789 "say his arm and pulls him back."
alias swIV3790 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3791 "say (gasping)"
alias swIV3792 "say I think we took a wrong turn."
alias swIV3793 "say Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby "
alias swIV3794 "say reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at "
alias swIV3795 "say the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch "
alias swIV3796 "say that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving "
alias swIV3797 "say them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.  "
alias swIV3798 "say Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door."
alias swIV3799 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3800 "say There's no lock!"
alias swIV3801 "say Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol."
alias swIV3802 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3803 "say That oughta hold it for a while."
alias swIV3804 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3805 "say Quick, we've got to get across. Find "
alias swIV3806 "say the control that extends the bridge."
alias swIV3807 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3808 "say Oh, I think I just blasted it."
alias swIV3809 "say Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the "
alias swIV3810 "say stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making "
alias swIV3811 "say ominous drilling and pounding sounds."
alias swIV3812 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3813 "say They're coming through!"
alias swIV3814 "say Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when "
alias swIV3815 "say laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol "
alias swIV3816 "say at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across "
alias swIV3817 "say the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops "
alias swIV3818 "say appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, "
alias swIV3819 "say and grabs at his chest."
alias swIV3820 "say Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by "
alias swIV3821 "say Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move "
alias swIV3822 "say back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia."
alias swIV3823 "say LUKE"
alias swIV3824 "say Here, hold this."
alias swIV3825 "say Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt. "
alias swIV3826 "say It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge "
alias swIV3827 "say overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the "
alias swIV3828 "say rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears "
alias swIV3829 "say and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.  "
alias swIV3830 "say Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet "
alias swIV3831 "say of more troops."
alias swIV3832 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3833 "say Here they come!"
alias swIV3834 "say Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and "
alias swIV3835 "say he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the "
alias swIV3836 "say gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He "
alias swIV3837 "say tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the "
alias swIV3838 "say princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him "
alias swIV3839 "say quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised."
alias swIV3840 "say LEIA"
alias swIV3841 "say For luck!"
alias swIV3842 "say Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss "
alias swIV3843 "say to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as "
alias swIV3844 "say Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the "
alias swIV3845 "say stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at "
alias swIV3846 "say the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into "
alias swIV3847 "say the tiny subhallway."
alias swIV3848 "say INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY"
alias swIV3849 "say Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several "
alias swIV3850 "say stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks "
alias swIV3851 "say to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the "
alias swIV3852 "say opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of "
alias swIV3853 "say the hallway and starts after the old Jedi."
alias swIV3854 "say INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY"
alias swIV3855 "say Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the "
alias swIV3856 "say pirateship entry ramp."
alias swIV3857 "say THREEPIO"
alias swIV3858 "say Where could they be?"
alias swIV3859 "say Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left "
alias swIV3860 "say and right, beeping a response."
alias swIV3861 "say INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR"
alias swIV3862 "say Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several "
alias swIV3863 "say troopers hot on their trail."
alias swIV3864 "say TROOPER"
alias swIV3865 "say Close the blast doors!"
alias swIV3866 "say At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in "
alias swIV3867 "say front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion "
alias swIV3868 "say race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage "
alias swIV3869 "say to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops "

alias swIV3896 "say Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked "
alias swIV3897 "say by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke "

alias swIV4353 "say The battle station is heavily shielded "
alias swIV4354 "say and carries a firepower greater than "

alias swIV4457 "say HAN"
alias swIV4458 "say What good's a reward if you ain't "

alias swIV4530 "say of shooting stars that'll never be "
alias swIV4531 "say stopped!"
alias swIV4532 "say Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for "
alias swIV4533 "say his ship."

alias swIV4537 "say back of the fighter."
alias swIV4538 "say CHIEF"
alias swIV4539 "say This R2 unit of your seems a bit "
