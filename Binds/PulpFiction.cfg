alias pulp17 "say going out of style."
alias pulp18 "say It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or "
alias pulp19 "say how old she is; everything she does contradicts something "
alias pulp20 "say she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is "
alias pulp21 "say to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion."
alias pulp22 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp23 "say No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm "
alias pulp24 "say through doin' that shit."
alias pulp25 "say YOUNG WOMAN"
alias pulp26 "say You always say that, the same thing "
alias pulp27 "say every time: never again, I'm through, "
alias pulp28 "say too dangerous."
alias pulp29 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp30 "say I know that's what I always say. I'm "
alias pulp31 "say always right too, but –"
alias pulp32 "say YOUNG WOMAN"
alias pulp33 "say – but you forget about it in a day "
alias pulp34 "say or two -"
alias pulp35 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp36 "say – yeah, well, the days of me "
alias pulp37 "say forgittin' are over, and the days of "

alias pulp50 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp51 "say Well take heart, 'cause you're never "

alias pulp53 "say since I'm never gonna do it again, "
alias pulp54 "say you're never gonna hafta hear me "
alias pulp55 "say quack about how I'm never gonna do "
alias pulp56 "say it again."

alias pulp76 "say coffee."
alias pulp77 "say The Young Man goes right back into it."
alias pulp78 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp79 "say I mean the way it is now, you're "
alias pulp80 "say takin' the same fuckin' risk as when "
alias pulp81 "say you rob a bank. You take more of a "
alias pulp82 "say risk. Banks are easier!  Federal "
alias pulp83 "say banks aren't supposed to stop you "
alias pulp84 "say anyway, during a robbery. They're "
alias pulp85 "say insured, why should they care? You "
alias pulp86 "say don't even need a gun in a federal "
alias pulp87 "say bank. I heard about this guy, walked "
alias pulp88 "say into a federal bank with a portable "
alias pulp89 "say phone, handed the phone to the teller, "

alias pulp95 "say Did it work?"
alias pulp96 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp97 "say Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm "
alias pulp98 "say talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in "
alias pulp99 "say a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, "
alias pulp100 "say not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, "
alias pulp101 "say cleans the place out, and they don't "
alias pulp102 "say lift a fuckin' finger."
alias pulp103 "say YOUNG WOMAN"
alias pulp104 "say Did they hurt the little girl?"
alias pulp105 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp106 "say I don't know. There probably never "
alias pulp107 "say was a little girl – the point of the "
alias pulp108 "say story isn't the little girl. The "
alias pulp109 "say point of the story is they robbed "
alias pulp110 "say the bank with a telephone."
alias pulp111 "say YOUNG WOMAN"
alias pulp112 "say You wanna rob banks?"
alias pulp113 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp114 "say I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, "
alias pulp115 "say I'm just illustrating that if we "

alias pulp118 "say YOUNG WOMAN"

alias pulp125 "say And no more liquor stores?"
alias pulp126 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp127 "say What have we been talking about? "
alias pulp128 "say Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, "
alias pulp129 "say it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too "
alias pulp130 "say many foreigners own liquor stores. "
alias pulp131 "say Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't "
alias pulp132 "say fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: "
alias pulp133 "say "Empty out the register," and they "
alias pulp134 "say don't know what it fuckin' means. "
alias pulp135 "say They make it too personal. We keep "
alias pulp136 "say on, one of those gook motherfuckers' "
alias pulp137 "say gonna make us kill 'em."
alias pulp138 "say YOUNG WOMAN"
alias pulp139 "say I'm not gonna kill anybody."
alias pulp140 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp141 "say I don't wanna kill anybody either. "
alias pulp142 "say But they'll probably put us in a "
alias pulp143 "say situation where it's us of them. And "
alias pulp144 "say if it's not the gooks, it these old "
alias pulp145 "say Jews who've owned the store for "
alias pulp146 "say fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got "
alias pulp147 "say Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the "
alias pulp148 "say counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try "
alias pulp149 "say walkin' into one of those stores "
alias pulp150 "say with nothin' but a telephone, see "
alias pulp151 "say how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget "
alias pulp152 "say it, we're out of it."

alias pulp164 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp165 "say This place."
alias pulp166 "say The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more."
alias pulp167 "say WAITRESS"
alias pulp168 "say (snotty)"
alias pulp169 "say "Garcon" means boy."
alias pulp170 "say She splits."
alias pulp171 "say YOUNG WOMAN"
alias pulp172 "say Here? It's a coffee shop."
alias pulp173 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp174 "say What's wrong with that? People never "
alias pulp175 "say rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor "
alias pulp176 "say stores, gas stations, you get your "
alias pulp177 "say head blown off stickin' up one of "
alias pulp178 "say them. Restaurants, on the other hand, "
alias pulp179 "say you catch with their pants down. "
alias pulp180 "say They're not expecting to get robbed, "
alias pulp181 "say or not as expecting."
alias pulp182 "say YOUNG WOMAN"
alias pulp183 "say (taking to idea)"
alias pulp184 "say I bet in places like this you could "
alias pulp185 "say cut down on the hero factor."
alias pulp186 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp187 "say Correct. Just like banks, these places "
alias pulp188 "say are insured. The managers don't give "
alias pulp189 "say a fuck, they're just tryin' to get "
alias pulp190 "say ya out the door before you start "
alias pulp191 "say pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget "
alias pulp192 "say it, they ain't takin' a bullet for "
alias pulp193 "say the register. Busboys, some wetback "
alias pulp194 "say gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour "
alias pulp195 "say gonna really give a fuck you're "
alias pulp196 "say stealin' from the owner. Customers "
alias pulp197 "say are sittin' there with food in their "
alias pulp198 "say mouths, they don't know what's goin' "
alias pulp199 "say on. One minute they're havin' a Denver "
alias pulp200 "say omelet, next minute somebody's "
alias pulp201 "say stickin' a gun in their face."
alias pulp202 "say The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man "
alias pulp203 "say continues in a low voice."
alias pulp204 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp205 "say See, I got the idea last liquor store "
alias pulp206 "say we stuck up. 'Member all those "
alias pulp207 "say customers kept comin' in?"
alias pulp208 "say YOUNG WOMAN"
alias pulp209 "say Yeah."
alias pulp210 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp211 "say Then you got the idea to take "
alias pulp212 "say everybody's wallet."
alias pulp213 "say YOUNG WOMAN"
alias pulp214 "say Uh-huh."
alias pulp215 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp216 "say That was a good idea."
alias pulp217 "say YOUNG WOMAN"
alias pulp218 "say Thanks."
alias pulp219 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp220 "say We made more from the wallets then "
alias pulp221 "say we did the register."

alias pulp228 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp229 "say Pretty smart, huh?"
alias pulp230 "say The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new "
alias pulp231 "say information."
alias pulp232 "say She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The "
alias pulp233 "say tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the "
alias pulp234 "say motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the "
alias pulp235 "say COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's "

alias pulp251 "say YOUNG MAN"
alias pulp252 "say I love you, Honey Bunny."
alias pulp253 "say And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, "
alias pulp254 "say stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona "
alias pulp255 "say is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is "
alias pulp256 "say that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon."
alias pulp257 "say PUMPKIN"

alias pulp1644 "say MIA"
alias pulp1645 "say You can't promise something like "

alias pulp1727 "say MIA"
alias pulp1728 "say A husband being protective of his "

alias pulp1813 "say The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-"
alias pulp1814 "say style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the "

alias pulp1822 "say (pause)"
alias pulp1823 "say Music and drinks!"

alias pulp1832 "say Vincent shuffles off to the john."
alias pulp1833 "say Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs "
alias pulp1834 "say and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high "
alias pulp1835 "say energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She "
alias pulp1836 "say dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's "
alias pulp1837 "say overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It "
alias pulp1838 "say feels good."
alias pulp1839 "say Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. "
alias pulp1840 "say Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco "
alias pulp1841 "say on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks "
alias pulp1842 "say the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a "
alias pulp1843 "say little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so "
alias pulp1844 "say anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out "
alias pulp1845 "say his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, "
alias pulp1846 "say trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you "
alias pulp1847 "say know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly "
alias pulp1848 "say brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, "
alias pulp1849 "say then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed."
alias pulp1850 "say The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she "
alias pulp1851 "say takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in "
alias pulp1852 "say the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something "
alias pulp1853 "say else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder "
alias pulp1854 "say inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. "
alias pulp1855 "say Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her "
alias pulp1856 "say face."

alias pulp1871 "say LIVING ROOM"
alias pulp1872 "say Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines "

alias pulp1877 "say Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels "

alias pulp1883 "say VINCENT"
alias pulp1884 "say ...It's a moral test of yourself, "
alias pulp1885 "say whether or not you can maintain "
alias pulp1886 "say loyalty. Because when people are "
alias pulp1887 "say loyal to each other, that's very "
alias pulp1888 "say meaningful."
alias pulp1889 "say LIVING ROOM"
alias pulp1890 "say Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but "
alias pulp1891 "say it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from "
alias pulp1892 "say her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her "

alias pulp1905 "say LIVING ROOM"
alias pulp1906 "say We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to "
alias pulp1907 "say the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like "
alias pulp1908 "say a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are "
alias pulp1909 "say down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the "
alias pulp1910 "say tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her "
alias pulp1911 "say face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. "
alias pulp1912 "say Slack-jawed."
alias pulp1913 "say VINCENT"
alias pulp1914 "say Jesus Christ!"
alias pulp1915 "say Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. "
alias pulp1916 "say Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck "
alias pulp1917 "say to check her pulse. She slightly stirs."
alias pulp1918 "say Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her."
alias pulp1919 "say VINCENT"
alias pulp1920 "say (sounding weird)"
alias pulp1921 "say Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?"
alias pulp1922 "say But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, "

alias pulp2417 "say stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to "

alias pulp2426 "say BUTCH (O.S.)"
alias pulp2427 "say Uh-huh."
alias pulp2428 "say MOTHER"
alias pulp2429 "say Well this here is Capt. Koons. He "

alias pulp2431 "say CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and "
alias pulp2432 "say bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's "
alias pulp2433 "say eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas "
alias pulp2434 "say accent."
alias pulp2435 "say CAPT. KOONS"
alias pulp2436 "say Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard "
alias pulp2437 "say a bunch about you. See, I was a good "
alias pulp2438 "say friend of your Daddy's. We were in "
alias pulp2439 "say that Hanoi pit of hell over five "
alias pulp2440 "say years together.  Hopefully, you'll "
alias pulp2441 "say never have to experience this "
alias pulp2442 "say yourself, but when two men are in a "
alias pulp2443 "say situation like me and your Daddy "
alias pulp2444 "say were, for as long as we were, you "
alias pulp2445 "say take on certain responsibilities of "
alias pulp2446 "say the other. If it had been me who had "
alias pulp2447 "say not made it, Major Coolidge would be "
alias pulp2448 "say talkin' right now to my son Jim. But "
alias pulp2449 "say the way it worked out is I'm talkin' "

alias pulp2452 "say The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket."
alias pulp2453 "say CAPT. KOONS"
alias pulp2454 "say This watch I got here was first "
alias pulp2455 "say purchased by your great-granddaddy. "
alias pulp2456 "say It was bought during the First World "
alias pulp2457 "say War in a little general store in "
alias pulp2458 "say Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought "
alias pulp2459 "say by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge "
alias pulp2460 "say the day he set sail for Paris. It "
alias pulp2461 "say was your great-granddaddy's war watch, "
alias pulp2462 "say made by the first company to ever "
alias pulp2463 "say make wrist watches. You see, up until "
alias pulp2464 "say then, people just carried pocket "
alias pulp2465 "say watches. Your great-granddaddy wore "
alias pulp2466 "say that watch every day he was in the "
alias pulp2467 "say war. Then when he had done his duty, "
alias pulp2468 "say he went home to your great-"
alias pulp2469 "say grandmother, took the watch off his "
alias pulp2470 "say wrist and put it in an ol' coffee "
alias pulp2471 "say can. And in that can it stayed 'til "
alias pulp2472 "say your grandfather Dane Coolidge was "
alias pulp2473 "say called upon by his country to go "
alias pulp2474 "say overseas and fight the Germans once "
alias pulp2475 "say again. This time they called it World "
alias pulp2476 "say War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave "
alias pulp2477 "say it to your granddad for good luck.  "
alias pulp2478 "say Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as "
alias pulp2479 "say good as his old man's. Your granddad "
alias pulp2480 "say was a Marine and he was killed with "
alias pulp2481 "say all the other Marines at the battle "
alias pulp2482 "say of Wake Island. Your granddad was "
alias pulp2483 "say facing death and he knew it. None of "
alias pulp2484 "say those boys had any illusions about "
alias pulp2485 "say ever leavin' that island alive. So "
alias pulp2486 "say three days before the Japanese took "
alias pulp2487 "say the island, your 22-year old "
alias pulp2488 "say grandfather asked a gunner on an Air "
alias pulp2489 "say Force transport named Winocki, a man "
alias pulp2490 "say he had never met before in his life, "
alias pulp2491 "say to deliver to his infant son, who he "
alias pulp2492 "say had never seen in the flesh, his "
alias pulp2493 "say gold watch. Three days later, your "
alias pulp2494 "say grandfather was dead. But Winocki "
alias pulp2495 "say kept his word. After the war was "
alias pulp2496 "say over, he paid a visit to your "
alias pulp2497 "say grandmother, delivering to your infant "
alias pulp2498 "say father, his Dad's gold watch. This "
alias pulp2499 "say watch. This watch was on your Daddy's "
alias pulp2500 "say wrist when he was shot down over "
alias pulp2501 "say Hanoi. He was captured and put in a "
alias pulp2502 "say Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew "
alias pulp2503 "say if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd "
alias pulp2504 "say be confiscated. The way your Daddy "
alias pulp2505 "say looked at it, that watch was your "
alias pulp2506 "say birthright. And he'd be damned if "
alias pulp2507 "say and slopeheads were gonna put their "
alias pulp2508 "say greasy yella hands on his boy's "
alias pulp2509 "say birthright. So he hid it in the one "
alias pulp2510 "say place he knew he could hide somethin'. "
alias pulp2511 "say His ass. Five long years, he wore "
alias pulp2512 "say this watch up his ass. Then when he "
alias pulp2513 "say died of dysentery, he gave me the "
alias pulp2514 "say watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk "
alias pulp2515 "say of metal up my ass for two years. "
alias pulp2516 "say Then, after seven years, I was sent "
alias pulp2517 "say home to my family. And now, little "
alias pulp2518 "say man, I give the watch to you."
alias pulp2519 "say Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes "

alias pulp4590 "say Take the body, stick it in the trunk. "
alias pulp4591 "say Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty "
alias pulp4592 "say domesticated house. That would lead "
alias pulp4593 "say me to believe that in the garage or "
alias pulp4594 "say under the sink, you got a bunch of "
alias pulp4595 "say cleansers and cleaners and shit like "
alias pulp4596 "say that, am I correct?"
alias pulp4597 "say JIMMIE"

alias pulp4604 "say need to go in the backseat, scoop up "
alias pulp4605 "say all those little pieces of brain and "

alias pulp4607 "say down the upholstery – now when it "
alias pulp4608 "say comes to upholstery, it don't need "
alias pulp4609 "say to be spic and span, you don't need "
alias pulp4610 "say to eat off it. Give it a good once "
alias pulp4611 "say over. What you need to take care of "
alias pulp4612 "say are the really messy parts. The pools "
alias pulp4613 "say of blood that have collected, you "
alias pulp4614 "say gotta soak that shit up.  But the "
alias pulp4615 "say windows are a different story.  Them "
alias pulp4616 "say you really clean. Get the Windex, do "
alias pulp4617 "say a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to "
alias pulp4618 "say raid your linen closet. I need "
alias pulp4619 "say blankets, I need comforters, I need "
alias pulp4620 "say quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker "
alias pulp4621 "say the better, the darker the better. "
alias pulp4622 "say No whites, can't use 'em. We need to "

alias pulp4624 "say We're gonna line the front seat and "
alias pulp4625 "say the backseat and the floor boards "
alias pulp4626 "say with quilts and blankets. If a cop "
alias pulp4627 "say stops us and starts stickin' his big "
alias pulp4628 "say snout in the car, the subterfuge "
alias pulp4629 "say won't last. But at a glance, the car "

alias pulp5031 "say JULES"
alias pulp5032 "say I wouldn't go so far as to call a "
alias pulp5033 "say dog filthy, but they're definitely "
alias pulp5034 "say dirty. But a dog's got personality. "
alias pulp5035 "say And personality goes a long way."
alias pulp5036 "say VINCENT"
alias pulp5037 "say So by that rationale, if a pig had a "
alias pulp5038 "say better personality, he's cease to be "
alias pulp5039 "say a filthy animal?"
alias pulp5040 "say JULES"
alias pulp5041 "say We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one "
alias pulp5042 "say motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd "

alias pulp5063 "say What's an act of God?"
alias pulp5064 "say VINCENT"
alias pulp5065 "say I guess it's when God makes the "

alias pulp5067 "say Jules, but I don't think what happened "
alias pulp5068 "say this morning qualifies."
alias pulp5069 "say JULES"
alias pulp5070 "say Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't "
alias pulp5071 "say matter. You're judging this thing "
alias pulp5072 "say the wrong way. It's not about what. "
alias pulp5073 "say It could be God stopped the bullets, "
alias pulp5074 "say he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found "
alias pulp5075 "say my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge "
alias pulp5076 "say shit like this based on merit. Whether "
alias pulp5077 "say or not what we experienced was an "
alias pulp5078 "say according-to-Hoyle miracle is "
alias pulp5079 "say insignificant. What is significant "
alias pulp5080 "say is I felt God's touch, God got "
alias pulp5081 "say involved."
alias pulp5082 "say VINCENT"
alias pulp5083 "say But why?"
alias pulp5084 "say JULES"
alias pulp5085 "say That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I "
alias pulp5086 "say don't know why. But I can't go back "
alias pulp5087 "say to sleep."
alias pulp5088 "say VINCENT"
alias pulp5089 "say So you're serious, you're really "
alias pulp5090 "say gonna quit?"
alias pulp5091 "say JULES"
alias pulp5092 "say The life, most definitely."
alias pulp5093 "say Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In "
alias pulp5094 "say the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress."
alias pulp5095 "say PATRON"
alias pulp5096 "say Garcon! Coffee!"
alias pulp5097 "say We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene "
alias pulp5098 "say of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny."
alias pulp5099 "say VINCENT"
alias pulp5100 "say So if you're quitting the life, "
alias pulp5101 "say what'll you do?"
alias pulp5102 "say JULES"
alias pulp5103 "say That's what I've been sitting here "
alias pulp5104 "say contemplating. First, I'm gonna "
alias pulp5105 "say deliver this case to Marsellus. Then, "
alias pulp5106 "say basically, I'm gonna walk the earth."
alias pulp5107 "say VINCENT"
alias pulp5108 "say What do you mean, walk the earth?"

alias pulp5520 "say and I'm the shepherd and it's the "
alias pulp5521 "say world that's evil and selfish.  I'd "
alias pulp5522 "say like that. But that shit ain't the "
alias pulp5523 "say truth. The truth is you're the weak. "
