Grab a cfg file, save it to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg" (or wherever TF2 is installed)

Launch the game, and in developer console type "exec filename.cfg" (filename being the name of the bind you want)

it will bind the key specified at the beginning of the file to say the script, default should be "k"
